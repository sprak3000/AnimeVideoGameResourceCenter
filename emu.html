<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Emulator Overview</H2>
Emulators allow you to mimic different hardware architectures.  For example,
there are Mac emulators which allow you to run Mac programs on your Intel-based
microprocessor (486, Pentium, etc.).  Thus, to run any of the games on these
pages, you must have the proper emulator.  The emulator translates the program
code in a file into the proper machine language instructions of the machine
running the emulator.  Because of hardware differences, emulators will very
rarely emulate a machine perfectly.  This is why you will experience glitches
in some of the games you come across.

<P>

So, how does one dump the contents of a cartridge into a file to run under
one of these emulators?  There are special devices that allow you to dump the
contents of the cartridge's EPROM into a file.  That is why you will see these
game files referred to as "ROMs" most of the time.  They also can be called 
"images" as well.  You can buy these cartridge copiers or even build one 
yourself.  These copiers can also create bad files if they don't properly
dump the EPROM contents into a file.
