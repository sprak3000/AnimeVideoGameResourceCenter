<p><strong>From Roger Nystrom:</strong><br />
<em>Attack! Saiyajin</em> follows Gokuu and Piccolo as they try to save Gohan from Radditz, then Garlick's attacks, and then concludes with a battle against Nappa and Vegeta. This is a game using an improved version of the DB battle card system. The graphics in this game have improved quite a bit as the battles are now acted out. The adventure element is pretty much gone in this game, leaving a more RPG-ish feel to the game. Other characters (Gohan, Piccolo, etc.) come under control and can all use their special attacks (such as the Kamehameha and Tenshinhan's body split). You can fight more than one enemy at a time adding more challenge, but this also makes the game suspect to being ganged up on.</p>		</td>
