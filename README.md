This is the source code for the [Anime Video Game Resource Center](https://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/avrc/). You can
fork it, install it on your own server, and have a complete reproduction of the site. The site is distributed via the

## Installation

This site must be run on a server using PHP 7.X.

## Additional Details

The `/video` directory holds some old [RealMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealMedia) files. There might be some 
way still to play them, but no efforts on my part have been made to do so.
