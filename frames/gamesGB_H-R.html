 Iron League is based on a TV anime that aired around 92-93 about a underdog robotic sports team that becomes a 
winning team (thanks to their new manager).  -- from Phillip Yee

The anime is about a very strange children's superhero anime.  The hero 
defeats villians by playing "jankenpon" (Paper, Scissors, Rock).  It is a
Mario-style, vertical scrolling game.

This is a racing game with some unique obstacles and weapons.  You must race
Kamen Rider past all these obstacles and enemies.  The game has some fair
graphics and fun game play.

This is a Zelda-style RPG.  I haven't played it much, but it looks like you
need to read Japanese to really understand what you are supposed to do in this
game.

This appears to be a war-strategy game.  I have not heard of this anime, but
it is in Ken Arromdee's list.

This is a rather poor fighting game.  Your character looks a little like
something out of Gundam.  I have never heard of this anime title, but it is in
Ken Arromdee's list.

Despite the poor graphics, this game is very entertaining.  You must retrieve
three items (a ribbon, a hat, and some gloves) to have Akane appear.  Once
Akane appears, you must tag her to complete the level.  In order to get these 
items, you must push around boxes, rocks, and logs to get to them.  Boxes and
rocks can be broken, but to remove logs, you must push two or more of them
togther.  Of course, Ranma's rivals and "girlfriends" are chasing him around
trying to stop him.

<P>

The puzzles are quite challenging at times.  Boxes can be broken open to
reveal hot or cold water.  These can change you back and forth from male
to female Ranma.  Male Ranma causes objects to move until they hit something
else.  Female Ranma can only move objects one spot at a time.  You must
figure out when each form is appropriate.  With 50 different puzzles to 
solve, you won't lose interest in this one for awhile.  Besides the poor
graphics, my only other complaint is that there is no password or saving
options.  You have three continues at your disposal, but no way to stop the
game and come back to it later.

This is a side-scrolling fighting and puzzle game.  Ranma walks around trying
to solve a puzzle, which usually invovles finding someone or something.
Occasionally, you will run into someone who wants to fight.  The fights use
standard punches and kicks; I haven't found any special moves yet.  I cannot
rate the game because I cannot get past Kuno's maze in level 2.  Help on this
level would be appreciated.

As best as I can translate, the title means <I>Status Play Dialogue</I>.  It is a stretegy game of an undescribable type.  
You play Ranma in the story mode, who goes around different parts of Japan and meets two types of people; the first are 
ones that have various reasons for beating the living snot out of Ranma (for example, in the first stage, there's the 
Principal, Kodachi, Kunou, Gosunkugi, and Ryouga), and characters which will ask you questions for points.

<P>

When you encounter battle characters, they will have a small dialogue and then you will be at a screen showing both 
your picture and your opponent's pictures, special move meters, and life meters.  Pressing <B>A button</B> will start a 
slot-machine-esque box <I>(Lucky Panel)</I> up, and pressing <B>A button</B> again stops it. This decides your luck in 
the match.  Sunny is the best, an umbrella means iffy, and a lemon means you're the farthest from having any luck of the 
sort.  Next will pop up your various battle attributes - the two top are <B>Power</B> and <B>Special Moves</B>, and the 
bottom two are <B>Defense</B> and <B>Life</B>.  Pressing <B>B button</B> and <B>A button</B> will lower and raise 
the various attributes, depending on how many points you have.  If you are satisfied with the adjustments, move to the 
first bottom Japanese word and hit <B>A button</B>; choosing the other one will reset the attributes.  A menu will then 
show up, letting you select various moves, which are abbreviated with <I>DF</I> (defend), <I>AT</I> (attack), and 
<I>SAT</I> (Super Attack).  Super attacks are the strongest but take off a ton off your meter.  

<P>

Attacks are potent, but will do nothing if countered with a super attack.  The battle will begin when you press 
<B>A button</B> to move to the selections (<I>Fight</I> or <I>Reset</I>); your first move will be paired up with your 
opponent's first; your second with his/her second, and so on until either all moves are done, or until someone runs out of 
life.  The reward for winning is more points for your battle attributes.

<P>

The question characters (Akane, Shampoo, and the like) will ask questions that pertain to Ranma knowledge; this is 
where even a little Japanese knowledge helps, as does an emulator with a pause feature.  Typical questions range from 
"Which word describes Akane's cooking" (Warui - bad) to "Which character first kissed Ranma?" (Mikado) The object is 
to answer six questions correctly before time runs out; each time you're wrong you are penalized with more time 
subtracted.  The reward is again, more points.

<P>

It helps in this game to scout out the town, remembering which houses have what.  Go for all of the question charaters 
first; even if your Japanese knowledge is nonexistent, try going for Kasumi or Shampoo in the first stage for example, 
where you'll have a 50/50 shot of being right, and your continues are unlimited, so you can go at it as long as it takes.  
In the first stage go for Gosunkugi and the Principal, and be sure to have your power boosted up high (A hundred or 
more is excellent!)  All characters except Kodachi and very few others always seem to block on the third move; use this 
to your advantage. 

<P>

Also, even if you only have one Game Boy or one emulator, the third option on the main menu (Versus) works for two 
players, each taking turns planning out his/her character of choice (even Tsubasa is in this one!), luck, attributes, and 
moves. While this isn't really a game that requires skill, it can test how well you can predict and outwit your opponent.
