This is a vertical-scrolling, shoot-em-up game.  I have never heard of
this anime, but it is listed in Ken Arromdee's list.  You collect various
power-ups along the way.  There are also two different characters you can
choose.  Some strange glitches seem to throw you into different parts of the
screen which kills you quickly.
