<p>You start out by choosing one of the three main characters as your primary pilot.  You then get to choose two secondary pilots from the remaining five pilots.  At any time other than boss battles, you can switch between the three pilots.

<p>Each stage consists of two levels.  In the first level, you fly around in fighter mode.  Before the second level, you can choose between fighter, gerwalk, and battroid modes.  You cannot change modes once you have selected it.  When you reach the end of the second stage, you will automatically change to battroid mode to fight the boss.

<p>Boss fights can take place one of two ways.  You shoot the boss as you normally would in battroid mode, or you have to dodge the boss' attacks while playing your instrument.  Playing your instrument involves pressing <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong> at the appropriate time.  You watch a bar at the bottom of the screen and hit the appropriate button depending on what note is supposed to be played.		</td>
