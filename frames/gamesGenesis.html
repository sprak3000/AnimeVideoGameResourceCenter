Yet another Mario-style platform game starring <I>Doraemon</I>, the Japanese equivalent of Bugs Bunny.  You run
around the levels collecting stars and super stars.  After collecting so many super stars, you are taken to a bonus
round where you must catch as many stars as you can before time runs out.  Many enemies stand in your way, but you
are armed with your trusty freeze ray.  Once an enemy is frozen, you can jump on him and use him as a platform to
jump to higher areas.  The frozen enemy can also be picked up and thrown at other enemies to destroy them.  If you hold
down long enough, Doraemon starts flashing indicating he is  powered up for a super jump.  The background for the levels
are made to look like pages out of the manga.

The US version of this <I>Hokuto no Ken</I> game was called <I>Last Battle</I>.  The character names have been 
radically altered in the US version.  You must travel around looking for your kidnapped girlfriend and prevent the bad 
guy from carrying out his evil plans.  There are basically two different types of levels in this game.  You start out in a 
city with bad guys coming after you.  After punching and kicking your way to the end of the city (usually be going all the 
way to the right), you have completed that stage.  A map appears letting you choose what city or place you want to go to 
next.  Depending on your choice, you either go to another city stage or you go to a one-on-one fighting stage.  In this 
stage, you must beat only one opponent in a typical <I>Street Fighter</I> match.  Have not found any special moves 
beyond the basic punch and kick.

This is a horizontal scrolling platform game.  There are two ways of defeating the enemies that come at you on each
level.  You can either hit them with your wand or throw something at them.  If you hit a background object like a 
trashcan or fire extinguisher, you pick it up and carry it in front of you.  Pressing the attack button again throws the
object in front of you destroying an enemy in its path.  Until you beat stage one, you do not get any magic powers; once
you do have them, you can only use them once.  The first magic power you get is temporary invunerability.

This is a fighting game that pits Ultraman against evil monsters in a typical <I>Street Fighter</I> match.  There are 
special attacks that you can use against your opponent, but I have not figured out how to block special attacks (the
monsters have blocked mine, so I am guessing you can block their special attacks).  Here is a list of the moves I have
found:

<UL>
<LI> <B>A+B:</B>  Fire an energy beam
<LI> <B>Down+Forward:</B>  Roll towards the enemy
<LI> <B>Down+Back:</B>  Do a backflip
<LI> <B>Down+B:</B>  Put up an energy shield
<LI> <B>Up+Back+C:</B>  Super jump backwards
<LI> <B>Up+Forward+C:</B>  Super jump forward
</UL>

<P>

The energy beam you fire works the same way as the SNES Ultraman game.  A meter at the top of the screen goes thru 
L1 - L4. Hitting the monster with L4 when <B>Finish</B> flashes will end the level.  As the power meter increases, 
<B>Down+B</B> loops the L1 - L4 counter.  -- from Don Switzer

This is a <I>Street Fighter</I> type game.  You can choose from 11 characters from the series.  This game is unique in
several ways.  It was one of the few games to utilize the 6 button Genesis controller;  also, it had the typical story mode, 
a practice mode, a tag team mode, a VS mode, and a 2 on 2 mode.  The 2 on 2 mode allows up to four players duke it
on the screen at one time.
