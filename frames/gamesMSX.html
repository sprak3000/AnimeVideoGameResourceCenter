This is exactly like the Gameboy game above, but it has color.  Other than
that, there appears to be no difference except that the levels may be set
up differently.  Haven't been able to play both games yet to see if the levels 
differ.

This is a rock-breaking puzzle game similar to the <I>Gameboy</I> version.  Uses Godzilla and cartoon versions of 
Godzilla and other monsters.

The title translates to "The Firebird" or "The Phoenix".  It is not the same
anime as the Gameboy game called "Fighbird".  This anime was created by Tezuka
Osamu who also created the anime <I>Astro Boy</I>.  It is a vertical-scrolling
shooter.

To play this game, copy the LDR file to a 720KB formatted disk.  Start 
fMSX with the "-disk a:" option and type RUN"LUPIN.LDR" when the MSX-Basic
screen appears.  You'll then get 2 questions. The first is "Monitor or 
TV".  You should always choose 0 (Monitor), because it's a Japanese game 
and thus written for 60Hz NTSC.  (Choosing TV will just slow down the 
game by 10%.)  The second question is a lot more useful.  For the normal 
game choose 0, choosing 1 gives you unlimited lives in Castle of 
Cagliostro.
 
<P>

The game has 8 stages. To finish a stage you have to find the two rings 
and the exit.  There are a number of items to be found, like bullets and 
flashlights.  In the top of the screen is a bar called "CUP"; when you 
pick up green (small) or red (big) cups of noodles it'll grow. When you 
find a hotwater-kettle your life will be (partially) renewed, depending 
on the amount of CUP aquired.

<P>

<B>Stage 1:</B>  First of all, hit all goatheads (some contain hidden 
items).  One of the hidden items is a rocket with a rope attached so 
you'll be able to go up in the upper room. Stand under the recess in the 
wall and press UP and A-button (spacebar). The rocket is now launched and
your a level higher.  Stand under the big goathead and jump (with B-button
or GRAPH-key).

<P>

<B>Stage 2:</B>  Hit all the busts to open the trap-door in the rightmost 
room. Of course, you'll have to hit all the goatheads too. There are also 
hidden items behind the lights. In the cellar, hit the chests on the left 
for extra items. At the big goathead, go up (you found another rocket if 
you've done everything right), take everything and go back to the goathead
and jump under it.  In principle all the other stages are finished 
similarly.  -- from Patriek Lesparre

<LI> Pressing UP and B-button (GRAPH-key) will change your bubble-ammo. 
The special ammo can be aquired by killing enemies.
<LI> When you fall in the room with the flames, you must destroy the 
flames by shooting bubbles at them, when you hold out long enough you'll 
get a reward and be bounced back up again.
<LI> Items will pop up when you pass certain points or jump at the right 
places.  Some of these will start a bonus game with Jigen or Goemon.

This is a standard horizontal-scrolling shooter much like the NES game above.
The graphics differ somewhat, but the gameplay is the same.

This seems to be a RPG game similar to the <I>Urusei Yatsura</I> game for
the Gameboy except with no fighting.  I haven't played it much and don't
really know what the goal of the game is.

This is the typical Gundam war strategy simulation.  You pick your officers
and troops and try to beat your opponent.  To play this game under fMSX,
you must copy the file to the drivea.dsk file in your fMSX directory.  Make
sure there are no carta.rom files in that directory; from there, you should
just be able to start fmsx without any ROM files listed on the command line,
and the game should boot right up.

<IMG SRC="../images/MSX/gun_msx.gif" ALT="[Mobile Suit Gundam:  Last Shooting]" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=212>
This is a multi-level game where each level has a different objective.  The
first level has your character dodge falling debris before entering his mobile
suit.  The second level has you shooting other mechs and gun emplacements.
Haven't played it past the second level.
