                        and is being guarded by not only his enemy's troops but also by Zenigata himself!  The treasure will only be revealed 
                        when you find the key that is placed somewhere on each level.  To avoid Zenigata and the various enemies, you are 
                        armed with the ability to hop on the blocks of the level.  Sounds like a useless ability doesn't it?  Fortunately, this 
                        causes the block you are standing on to rise up carrying you out of reach of your enemy's grasp.  It also allows you 
                        to jump across the pits that are scattered around the level.

                        <P>Of course, pits are not the only obstacles you must overcome.  A time limit, slippery ice, floors that throw you in 
                        unexpected directions, and even Zenigata throwing handcuffs at you prevent you from stealing the treasure.  As 
                        always, Lupin comes equipped with a variety of gadgets to assist him.  Occasionally, you will
 find a walkie-talkie on 
                        the level.  Jumping onto it will call Jigen or Goemon to help you.  While you go after the treasure, Jigen or Goemon 
                        will run around taking out any enemies in their path.

                        <P>This is an entertaining yet difficult puzzle game;  each enemy has several levels you must complete.  As the levels 
                        progress, the obstacles and enemies increase making it very difficult to steal the treasure before time runs out.  The 
                        music is standard fare but also helps you establish a rhythm as you try to complete each level.  Unfortunately, the 
                        game has no mechanism for continuing the game at a later time; once you turn the game off and back on, you have to 
                        start over from the beginning.  Otherwise, this is a highly addictive game and well worth playing over and over.		</td>
