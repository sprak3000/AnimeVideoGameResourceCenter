Sailor Moon returns with the Outer Senshi, and this time they're fighting... each other.  This game can be best
described as a reverse <em>Tetris</em> with balloons versus an opponent (or a reverse <em>Puzzle Fighter</em> - LAC).  
You get to choose from Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter, Sailor Venus, and Sailor Chibimoon in 
the normal game mode (first option on the screen).  The second option lets you set up a 2-player versus mode, winner 
being the one who takes two out of three matches. The third mode is a timed trial, making you empty the <em>pit</em> in
the alloted time.  When you select any of these three modes, the options <em>Start</em> and <em>Continue</em> will appear. 

<P>The game play is simple; two senshi walk along the bottom of the screen and pop balloons that continue to rise in the 
<em>pit</em> preventing the ballons from stacking beyond the pit.  By destroying a balloon that is next to a balloon of the 
same color, they will all blow up and depending on how many blow up, they will turn into a silver balloon.  This silver
ballon is unbreakable unless it is next to a set of balloons when you destroy them.  This silver balloon will go over to 
your opponent's side.  By blowing up single balloons, it will fill up the gauge on the side of your pit.  By filling it halfway, 
you can get assistance from Tuxedo Mask, who will take a row from your pit.  This will lower your gauge.  If your gauge 
is completely filled, you will then be able to pull off a super move just like they do in the show, affecting either your or 
your opponent's pit.  For example, Venus uses her <em>Love and Beauty Shock</em> to change her last four rows into 
balloons of the same color, while Mars makes some of her opponent's balloons turn into silver ones.  

<P>A word of warning is that popping a set of like balloons lowers your gauge, and emptying it completely will cause you to 
untransform, leaving you able to only break one balloon at a time.  The game overall is quite addictive and 
<strong>extremely</strong> sweet, with high-pitched super move cries and SD-characters as far as the eye can see. - Roger Nystrom		</td>
