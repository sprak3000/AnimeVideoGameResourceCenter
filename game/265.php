This is a basketball game based on the popular anime. It is easier to play than the first one was, but the controls still take some practice to understand them. You see 
a top view of the court with all your players listed as numbered circles. The player with the ball is a completely solid circle. When you shoot, you are given a bar with 
a moving cursor. You hit the shoot button again when it is in the dark band of the bar for a more accurate shot. There are other times when you confront an opposing 
player and must dribble or pass around him, or you are defending against an opposing player and must try to steal the ball or stop him from going around you. 		</td>
