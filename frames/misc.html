As people have sent me information, a lot of it has ended up in the bit bucket.  Well, I have decided to recycle some of
this information on this page.  What you will find in here is various bits of trivia as well as miscellaneous FAQs that
just don't fit in anywhere else at this time.  Enjoy!

Did you know that <I>Spellcaster</I> for the Master System and <I>Mystic Defender</I> for the Genesis are actually 
retouched <I>Kujaku-Ou</I> games?  In case you don't know, <I>Kujaku-Ou</I> (Peacock King) is an occult/horror

Remember laser disc based arcade games like <I>Dragon's Lair</I>?  Well, as some people may know, <I>Cliffhanger</I>
used footage from <I>Castle of Cagliostro</I> and <I>Mystery of Mamo</I> to the same effect.  Doug Cranston has also
pointed out that <I>Escape from Cyber City</I> for the CDI uses footage from the two <I>Galaxy Express</I> movies as 
did the old and obscure arcade game <I>Galaxy 999</I>.  <I>Bega's Battle</I> by Data East used footage from 
<I>Harmageddon</I>.
