"Nara no Suke" is a name, and YABOU means "ambition."  The name is a pun 
on the popular game "Nobunaga's Ambition."  This is why the second "no" is 
smaller than the first.  This is a Mario-style, horizontal-scrolling 
platform game for the Sega Game Gear.  I have heard of this anime but know 
very little about it.

The game has you running around avoiding enemies, but I don't know what 
the purpose of the game is.  You occasionally find doors that teleport you
to different parts of the playing field.
