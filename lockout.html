	<DD>No territorial lock out was used.

<P><DT> <B>Game Gear</B>
	<DD>The Game Gear uses a languauge lock out of a sort.  A hardware switch is needed to change between english and japanese language 
	games.  You could play most of the games without the switch and not have any problems though.

<P><DT> <B>Genesis</B>
	<DD>The Genesis uses a language lock out involving a built-in switch and megahertz settings used in the Mega Drive.  Since the Genesis 
	has neither of these, your only hope is to build a language switch and cut plastic from your Genesis to make the cartrige fit.  You can also
	buy a converter with a language switch.  Many Genesis games contain the roms for their Japanese counterparts, such as 
	<I>Mystic Defender</I>.  If a language switch is set to Japanese, it plays the Japanese version of the game.

<P><DT> <B>NES</B>
	<DD>The NES used a hardware lock out.  Famicom cartridges used 60 pin connectors while NES carts used 72 pin
	connectors.  The most well-known and hard to find adaptor was created by <I>Honeybee</I>.  Another recent adaptor was called the <I>Super 8</I>; 
	it allowed you to play NES, Famicom, and SFC games on your SNES.  It is also hard to find anyone selling it as well.  Since NES carts go very 
	cheap these days, someone also discovered a low cost solution.  Apparently, old cartidges made by Nintendo contain a 60 to 72 pin convertor 
	built-in.  A more <A HREF="http://atarihq.com/tsr/odd/scans/adapter.html">detailed description</A> of this process is available at 
	<A HREF="http://atarihq.com/tsr/">tsr's NES Archive</A>.

<P><DT> <B>PC-Engine</B>
	<DD>Both the PC-Engine and the Turbo Graphx-16 had a hardware lock out.  An adaptor could be bought to play PC-Engine games 
	on the Turbo Graphx-16; however, the PC-Engine has no way of playing Turbo Graphx-16 games.

<P><DT> <B>PSX</B>
	<DD>The PSX uses a hardware lock out.  To defeat the lock out, you must install a mod chip onto your PSX board.  This requires
	opening the PSX and soldering the mod chip onto the board.  Many places will sell you mod chips with instruction on where to
	solder it, but some places also offer to modify your PSX for you (if you are uncomfortable with soldering).  Essentially, every PSX
	games has a country code encoded on the CD itself.  When you turn on your PSX, the code is read off the CD and compared to the
	code stored in your PSX deck; if they match, the game will play.  The mod chip bypasses this country code check and lets you play
	any game from any country.

<P><DT> <B>Saturn</B>
	<DD>The Saturn has a hardware territorial lock out system.  A switch can be installed to defeat the lock out; 
	<A HREF="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/saturn/faq/saturn_import_switch.txt">a complete description</A> of the process is available
	at <A HREF="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">www.gamefaqs.com</A>.

<P><DT> <B>Sega Master System</B>
	<DD>No territorial lock out was used.

<P><DT> <B>SNES</B>
	<DD>The SNES lock out is completely cosmetic.  If you compare a SFC cartridge with a SNES cartridge, you will notice that the SNES cartridge 
	has two notches in the back that the SFC cartridge does not.  Now, push in the flap where you plug in the cartridge on your SNES deck.  If you 
	look inside, you should see two plastic pieces sticking up that correspond to the notches on your SNES cartridge.

	<P>You now have two choices.  You could cut notches in your SFC cartridge to match the plastic pieces inside.  Or, you could simply cut the 
	plastic pieces off.  I recommend the second choice; it is easier and less noticeable.  I have found that the easiest way to remove them is to take 
	a pair of hand-held garden shears to clip them out.

	<P>The same tabs exist on the SNES Game Genie and can be removed as well.  If you are uncomfortable with either of these methods, you 
	can buy adaptors which essentially extends the cartridge slot.  The only adaptor I would consider buying would be the <I>Super 8</I> adaptor.  It 
	allows you to play SNES, SFC, NES, and Famicom cartridges on your SNES deck.  Unfortunately, I have never actually seen anyone selling this.  
	Mark Drefahl has also suggested that the <I>X-band</I> device for the SNES also makes a good adaptor without modification (<I>ed.</I>  He 
	has no SFC cartridges to test it with, and I have never seen the X-band device.  Not sure if actually works or not).
