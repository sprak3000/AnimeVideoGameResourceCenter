This is a basketball game based on the popular anime.  It isn't a pure 
basketball game though; it uses a strange card system to make your plays.  A
card allows you to pass, shoot, or dribble around a person.  I don't know 
enough Japanese to figure out what card does what.  The game allows you to go
through a story mode(?) or just play a single game.
