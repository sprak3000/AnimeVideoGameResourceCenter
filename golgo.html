This game runs best under iNES.  It is your standard horizontal scrolling
game with basically two types of game play.  In one type, you are walking
around talking to agents to locate the evil "Condor".  Along the way, 
enemy agents pop up and attack you.  You start out with a kick as your only
weapon, but you get a gun after defeating the first enemy agent you encounter.
The second type is a shooting gallery type view.  Various enemy agents pop
up, and you must aim your sniper's sight at them to kill them.
