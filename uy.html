The intro starts with Ataru and Lum walking/flying to school saying they should
 hurry up, but when they get there Megane comes running screaming:  "Ataru! 
It's WEIRD! Look over there!"  There is a plaque are which says something about
 a Miss-contest, and what I understand is that Lum will compete...

<P>

In the game you are Ataru. You wander about through the halls of Tomobiki
Highschool fighting Urusei Yatsura characters like Lum's Stormtroopers,
Benten, Ran and many others.

At certain places certain coordinates are given to you. You should go to them 
and finish any business you have there. You will then recieve new coordinates 
(given you walk in the right place!).  Here's a list and some hints. You still 
have to play the full game, because things appear only when you've been told 
the coordinates!  -- Patriek Lesparre

This is a horizontal-scrolling platform game.  Lum starts out in a nursery 
school shooting ghosts and other enemies.  Thanks to Patriek, I now know
that the ROM I had was faulty.  NESA works fine with the new ROM he sent me.
A cute game, but the gameplay isn't very complex.
