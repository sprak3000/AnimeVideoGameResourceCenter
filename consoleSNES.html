In 1991, Nintendo released the Super Famicom to the 
Japanese market.  The Super Nintendo Entertainment System hit the US
market the same year.  The SNES was Nintendo's 16-bit answer to Sega's
Genesis system released two years previously.  With its <I>Mode 7</I>
graphics system, the SNES showed off some impressive effects such scaling,
incredible background effects, and other visual delights.

<P>Again, the powers that be felt that the US market should not be able to
play Japanese games outright.  This time, the territorial lockout was 
simpler to defeat.  If you compare a SFC cartridge with a SNES cartridge,
you will notice that the SNES cartridge has two notches in the back that
the SFC cartridge does not.  Now, push in the flap where you plug in the
cartridge on your SNES deck.  If you look inside, you should see two plastic
pieces sticking up that correspond to the notches on your SNES cartridge.

<P>You now have two choices.  You could cut notches in your SFC cartridge to
match the plastic pieces inside.  Or, you could simply cut the plastic
pieces off.  I recommend the second choice; it is easier and less noticeable.
I have found that the easiest way to remove them is to take a pair of 
hand-held garden shears to clip them out.  The same tabs exist on the SNES Game Genie 
and can be removed as well.  If you are uncomfortable with either of these methods, you 
can buy adaptors which essentially extends the cartridge slot.  The only adaptor
I would consider buying would be the <I>Super 8</I> adaptor.  it allows
you to play SNES, SFC, NES, and Famicom cartridges on your SNES deck.
Unfortunately, I have never actually seen anyone selling this.  Mark Drefahl has also 
suggested that the X-band device for the SNES also makes a good adaptor without 
modification (ed.  He has no SFC cartridges to test it with, and I have never seen the X-band 
device.  Not sure if actually works or not).

I first heard of this device roughly around 1995.  It was slated for release as a new accessory for the Super Famicom in Japan.
It would use smaller cartridges and allow developers to design smaller games with many parts.  Since then, I heard nothing
more about this device until now.  Lasse Reinikainen has informed me that the <I>Sufami Turbo</I> did not become vaporware.
What follows below is what he has learned about this device.

<P>The <I>Sufami Turbo</I> is add-on unit for Super Famicom.  You plug it into the game module connector as a normal 
game module.  <I>Sufami Turbo</I> has two game module slots (not normal ones).

<P>The idea must be something like this:  <I>Sufami Turbo</I> has some built-in resources (Japanese fonts, etc.) that 
allows you to save space when releasing modules (cartridges) for it.  Possibly there is some multiplayer capabilities 
as well.  I think the biggest advantage was that you can forget Nintendo and release games without licensing them 
(no paying money to Nintendo).

<P>Jacob Poon adds that it's biggest feature is the ability to have two cartridges to share common resources.  It is much 
like Sega's <I>Sonic and Knuckles</I> device.  For example, you can plug in two SD Ultraman games and use Ultraseven
in the game he is not featured in.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Licenced to Copy - By Nintendo</H2>

<HR>

<P>Available only in Japan, Nintendo actually makes a game copier of its own.
It's called <I>Nintendo Power</I>.

<P>Sharing the same name as Nintendo's magazine, <I>Nintendo Power</I> (NP for
short) allows you to copy a game from this machine and play it on your
SNES console at a significantly lower cost. 

<P>It works something like this:  first, you buy a SFC cart named <I>SF Memory
Cassette</I>, which contains 32Mbit flash memory and 256kbit SRAM for 3980
yen.  Then you go to a shop with a NP machine, insert the cart, and choose
the title(s) you want from the machine.  If your cart is already full, you
will need to delete some space.  After you have downloaded the games, you
go to the counter and pay for the titles and receives the manual(s) for
the respective game(s) within 3 minutes.

<P>The titles for NP cost 1000 yen (old) to 3000 yen (new ones, especially
the ones sold exclusively for NP) each, which is much cheaper than they
were originally released. 

<P>There are, however, some titles are missing from the NP releases.  All the
titles that require special chips like DSP, Super FX, etc. are not
available as part of NP inventory. 

<P>Note:  2 Mbit titles (e.g., Space Invader) automatically rounded up to use 1
block of flash memory each.  Similarly, 10 Mbit title (e.g., Final Fight 2) 
uses 3 blocks of flash memory. 

<P>See details (in Japanese) at:  <A HREF="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n03/index.html">the Japanese Nintendo site</A>.
