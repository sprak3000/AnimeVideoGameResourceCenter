<HR>

<H3>Can you send me ROM or game X?</H3>
No!  Don't ever ask me this question.  If you do, I will never respond to another email, pass your
name along to the net.gremlins, and forever curse your name.  Try learning how to use a search
engine!

<HR>

<H3>Is there some way I can contribute to the site?</H3>
Yes!  There is plenty of information about these games and systems that I do not have.  If you
have a link, summary, or other piece of information, <A HREF="mailto:cruzl@ccs.neu.edu">mail it</A> to me.
I will post it and figure out some way to say thanks!  I am specifically looking for people to fill in series summaries
and RPG information.

<HR>

<H3>What does acronym X mean?</H3>
Check the <A HREF="glossary.html">glossary</A>.
