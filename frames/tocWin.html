There aren't many anime-based <I>Windows</I> games out there except for
the hentai games (which usually aren't based on anime anyway).  There is
one person who has created his own home-brew anime games.  Check out the
<A HREF="http://www.amaranth.com/~csmith/arcade/arcade.html" TARGET="_top">Anime Game Arcade</A>
by Chris Smith.  You can find some pinball games there as well as some
classic games like <I>Breakout</I> with an anime twist.  Below are two
sample screenshots.  There is also a <A HREF="http://www.stoichion.com/zips/sol.zip">Sailor Moon Solitaire</A> game available that uses pics of the 
characters for the cards (no screen shot availble yet).  Some tile games 
of some anime characters have been made (no screen shot available yet) as 
well.
