Role-playing game featuring the cast of Ranma 1/2.  Combat is non-real-time based on speed scores.  Oddly enough, 
this allows Ranma (the fastest character) to take extra turns if you get his speed high enough.  Ranma, Akane, Shampoo, 
Ryouga, Genma, and Mousse are the playable characters and are controled in that order.  Cologne allows you to switch 
party members latter on.  Happosai is a boss but not the end boss.  The Kunos pretend to be boss characters.  Ukyou 
just kind of sits there.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">From Roger Nystrom:</H3>
People who bought or rented this will recognize the moves and play, and even the English lettering, in this first Ranma 1/2 
title (yes, you knew that clown's spinning looked familiar).  In this game, whose title means <I>Neighborhood Combat</I>, 
Ranma enters a tournament for the prize of <I>seeing China</I>.  He believes that, if he wins, he can revisit China and get 
rid of his curse of changing gender when hit with cold water.  However, there are others who either want the prize 
themselves or just want to beat up Ranma.  He battles through six enemies (Genma, Kodachi, Kuno, Principal, Shampoo, 
and Ryouga), deciding whether to battle as a boy or girl. There are two bonus stages (missing from the American version) 
where you fight Happosai and Cologne in the Tendou training hall, hitting them as many times as you can.  Your reward for 
winning the tournament is , well, seeing China alright.  I won't spoil the Ranma-esque ending, but just think of 
<I>Ranma and Juliet</I>, and how that episode ended.

<P>Control is easier than most SF-like games (too simplistic for some).  Pressing <FONT SIZE=-1><B>X button</B></FONT> will unleash a special 
attack, but you can execute other moves by pressing punch and kick together, or pressing punch rapidly, or jumping 
away from an opponent or straight up and hitting <FONT SIZE=-1><B>X button</B></FONT> (only some of these work on certain characters).  In 
addition, you have various punches and kicks by pressing a direction and the attack button.

<P>To get an enhanced VS. mode selection, hold down <FONT SIZE=-1><B>L button</B> and <B>R button</B></FONT> and then move the cursor to 
VS (first option).  Hit <FONT SIZE=-1><B>Start</B></FONT>, and then let go of <FONT SIZE=-1><B>L button</B> and <B>R button</B></FONT>.  You can choose whether 
the opponents are computer or human (and if they are computer, their play attributes), the stage with <FONT SIZE=-1><B>Select</B></FONT>, and 
best of all, you can not only play the same character but now Happosai and Cologne are at your disposal!

<P>To get extra credits in Story Mode, go to <B>Options</B>, and go to <B>Credits</B>.  Press <FONT SIZE=-1><B>Select</B></FONT> repeatedly 
until the credit counter turns to 50.  Overall, this game is too short, but is a fun piece of Ranma merchandise.  In my 
opinion its graphics are better than <I>Hard Battle</I>'s, even though the characters are smaller, and it's a shame we didn't get 
to see the real game here in the US.

This is the second fighting game based on the series <I>Ranma 1/2</I>.  The US release contained horrible dubbing of the voices.  
Fortunately, none of the characters were redesigned.

This is a unique Tetris-type game that bases matches on the game <I>Rock, Paper, Scissors</I>.  You get to choose a
character to play in story mode or VS mode.  Various three block rows slowly fall from the top of the screen.  Each block
is either a stone (purple or green), a scissors symbol, a paper symbol, and a rock symbol.  To remove items, you must
match blocks that would win a round of <I>Rock, Paper, Scissors</I>.  For example, placing a paper symbol on top of a
rock symbol removes the rock symbol and any other rock symbols directly below that one.  Why?  Because paper covers
rock.

<P>The purple and green stones can be removed as well, but I am not sure of the mechanics that determine how.  Also, if
you remove enough items at one time, you can unleash a <I>Special Attack</I> (e.g., Ranma's <I>Tenshin Amaguriken</I>)
on your opponent.  This will cause many blocks to fall into your opponent's area; the stronger the attack, the more blocks
that fall down on your opponent.  Of course, your opponent can do the same to you.  I have yet to get a full understanding
of the mechanics of how attacks are measured.

A US release of this game was scheduled; but due to the lousy translation and dubbing of the previous 
game <I>Ranma 1/2:  Hard Battle</I>, it was scrapped a few months before it was to be released (I do have a US magazine 
advertisement of it).
