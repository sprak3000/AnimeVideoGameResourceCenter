In 1989, Nintendo released its hand-held game 
system.  The Gameboy brought portable gaming to the masses as well as 
eye-strain and wide-spread <I>Tetris</I> addiction.  Despite the small
green and yellow dot-matrix screen, the Gameboy brought a wide variety of
games to the market including the popular <I>Final Fantasy</I> series.
The best news for gamers was that there was no territorial lockout on the
Gameboy.  Japanese cartridges could be played on US distributed Gameboys
without any hassle (not that you could find many import stores selling
them).

<P>The Gameboy has recently had three attempts to keep life in the system.  
The first and best attempt was the release of the <I>Super Gameboy</I>.  
This device allowed you to play Gameboy games on your SNES.  This provided
you with a larger picture to view.  It did not allow the game to fit your
entire TV screen; so, they gave you the ability to put various backgrounds
around the game.  The best feature was the ability to add color to the
games.  You could choose from pre-set color schemes or create your own. 
Eventually, the Gameboy games themselves came with the ability to display
their own color schemes and backgrounds.

<P>The other two attempts were cosmetic.  The Gameboy unit was first given
different color schemes.  How this was supposed to boost sales was anyone's
guess.  The most recent change was turning the Gameboy into the <I>Pocket</I>
Gameboy.  The new model was significantly smaller and thinner than the old
model and used fewer batteries.
