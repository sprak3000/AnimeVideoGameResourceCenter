<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Duke Nukem 3D Patches</H3>
In the old days, there was a cute platform game called <I>Duke Nukem</I>.
  Today, Duke is grown up and is rippin' apart <I>Doom</I> and 
<I>Quake</I>.  You run, jump, shoot, and swim your way through hordes of
aliens bent on world domination (don't they have anything better to do?).
  Since <I>Duke Nukem 3D</I> is still relatively new, there is only one
patch for it.  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dimensional.com/users/mackys/" TARGET="_top">Priss Nukem 3D</A> lets
you blast away the aliens as Priss.  This is a very good patch for 
<I>Bubblegum Crisis</I> fans as well as ordinary <I>Duke Nukem 3D</I> 
fans.
