<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Emulation</H1>
Briefly, an emulator is a program that allows the machine code for a
certain microprocessor to be run on a completely different microprocessor.
It is a complex task to achieve though; it requires an in-depth knowledge
of both the microprocessor you are emulating as well as the microprocessor
running the emulator.

<P>

What is the point of having an emulator if you don't have any programs to
run on it?  Well, you could learn the assembly language for the processor
being emulated and write your own programs for it.  Or you can search
around for ROMs or cartridge images of your favorite games from the past.
These ROM files are created by a machine that essentially just dumps all
the machine code from a cartridge into a computer file.  From there, it is
up to the emulator to read in that file and execute the code.

<P>

If you are looking for emulators or links to ROM sites, look no further 
than <A HREF="http://archaic-ruins.parodius.com/" TARGET="_top">Archaic Ruins</A> or
<A HREF="http://mana.nfinity.com/node99/index.html" TARGET="_top">Node 99</A>.  They are your one stop shopping center
for information on emulators and the emulation scene.  The only piece of
advice I have is to keep several different emulators for a specific 
machine on hand.  Some emulators run some games better than others.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">The Facts</H2>
<DL>
<DT> <B>FACT #1</B>
     <DD> I will not give you ROMs nor will any ROMs ever be posted on this
page.  The same goes for any other games that are linked to by my site.  Do not 
ask for ROMs ever as I will simply delete any and all email that you send me.
<DT> <B>FACT #2</B>
     <DD> Unless you own the actual cartridge, having a ROM is illegal.  There is 
no grey area around it.  Download a ROM and try it for 24 hours.  After that, you 
are toeing the legal line.
<DT> <B>FACT #3</B>
     <DD> I will not give you ROMs nor will any ROMs ever be posted on this 
page.  I know this is the same as FACT #1, but it is so important that it needed 
to be said twice.

What's that you say?  You're too lazy to browse through the links on 
Archaic Ruins?  You want ROM images for the games on my page now?!  Well,
I don't carry them myself, but these kind people have kindly used part of
their web space to host ROM images of these games.  Be sure to drop them
a note of thanks after grabbing any of these files.  Also, direct any
problems you have downloading them to the author of that page.  You will
find the largest collection at <A HREF="http://www.cudenver.edu/~mstilman/anime/stuff/index.html" TARGET="_top">Mike
Stilman's page</A> and at <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Towers/8301/emulate.htm" TARGET="_top">The 
Duck's page</A>.
