					<ul>						<li>Action</li>					</ul>			</ul>This game is based on the anime starring Toei's mascot Perrault (named after the author of <em>Puss 'n' Boots</em>). This game is based 
very closely on the <em>Puss 'n' Boots movie Around the World in 80 Days</em> where you must make it around the world to win a bet 
using all different forms of transportation while avoiding cat guild asassins (they want to kill Perrault because he has mice for 
friends). Fun game with lots of variety. - Doug Cranston		</td>
