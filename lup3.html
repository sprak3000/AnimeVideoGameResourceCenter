This is a puzzle game.  You guide Lupin to find the treasure on the level.
You must avoid Zenigata and other enemies; along the way you can find help
from Jigen, etc.

<P>

The graphics are not that great, but the puzzles are interesting to solve.
Overall, it is not a very good game (but I like it because I am a HUGE Lupin 
fan).

To play this game, copy the LDR file to a 720KB formatted disk.  Start 
fMSX with the "-disk a:" option and type RUN"LUPIN.LDR" when the MSX-Basic
screen appears.  You'll then get 2 questions. The first is "Monitor or 
TV".  You should always choose 0 (Monitor), because it's a Japanese game 
and thus written for 60Hz NTSC.  (Choosing TV will just slow down the 
game by 10%.)  The second question is a lot more useful.  For the normal 
game choose 0, choosing 1 gives you unlimited lives in Castle of 
Cagliostro.
 
<P>

The game has 8 stages. To finish a stage you have to find the two rings 
and the exit.  There are a number of items to be found, like bullets and 
flashlights.  In the top of the screen is a bar called "CUP"; when you 
pick up green (small) or red (big) cups of noodles it'll grow. When you 
find a hotwater-kettle your life will be (partially) renewed, depending 
on the amount of CUP aquired.

<P>

<B>Stage 1:</B>  First of all, hit all goatheads (some contain hidden 
items).  One of the hidden items is a rocket with a rope attached so 
you'll be able to go up in the upper room. Stand under the recess in the 
wall and press UP and A-button (spacebar). The rocket is now launched and
your a level higher.  Stand under the big goathead and jump (with B-button
or GRAPH-key).

<P>

<B>Stage 2:</B>  Hit all the busts to open the trap-door in the rightmost 
room. Of course, you'll have to hit all the goatheads too. There are also 
hidden items behind the lights. In the cellar, hit the chests on the left 
for extra items. At the big goathead, go up (you found another rocket if 
you've done everything right), take everything and go back to the goathead
and jump under it.  In principle all the other stages are finished 
similarly.  -- from Patriek Lesparre

To play this game, copy the LDR file to a 720KB formatted disk.  Start 
fMSX with the "-disk a:" option and type RUN"ARSENE.LDR" when the 
MSX-Basic screen appears.  You'll then get 2 questions.  The first is 
"Monitor or TV". You should always choose 0 (Monitor), because it's a 
Japanese game and thus written for 60Hz NTSC. (Choosing TV will just slow

For the normal game choose 0, choosing 1 gives you immortality.  -- from

<LI> Pressing UP and B-button (GRAPH-key) will change your bubble-ammo. 
The special ammo can be aquired by killing enemies.
<LI> When you fall in the room with the flames, you must destroy the 
flames by shooting bubbles at them, when you hold out long enough you'll 
get a reward and be bounced back up again.
<LI> Items will pop up when you pass certain points or jump at the right 
places.  Some of these will start a bonus game with Jigen or Goemon.
