This game follows the story line of Sailor Moon from the very beginning to the end of the first story(?). You must guide Usagi around various places and talk to 
various people. Once you have talked to the right combination of people, you will transform into Sailor Moon and enter a horizontal-scrolling action sequence. You 
must fight your way through the bad guys to get to the level boss(es). Once you defeat the level boss(es), you go to the next level to begin the process over again. 

<p>The graphics are fair, but the action is very limited. Your only attack is a pathetic looking kick. There is no password or save feature for this game. You can 
continue, but it takes you all the way back to the beginning of the level. 		</td>
