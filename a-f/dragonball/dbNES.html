This is the very first Dragon Ball Game, and the title translates as <I>The Secret of Shen Long (Holy Dragon)</I>.  This 
game was also reedited (many argue rather poorly) as <I>Dragon Power</I> here in the US.  The game follows the now 
famous mountain-boy Gokuu as he and genius-girl Bulma look for the seven Dragon Balls; which, when put together, 
summons Shen Long and allows one wish to be made.

<P>Gokuu loses power when touched by enemies, but also loses power over time (supposedly this is hunger kicking in).  
To counter this, Gokuu can find various candies or snacks when he defeats enemies.  He can also find different types of 
staffs (one normal, one which makes Gokuu a spinning dervish), panties (makes you run faster), and keys.  If you can't 
get anywhere, you should try to defeat enemies or bust open pots for keys.

<P>The game play is very sporadic.  Sometimes it's a complete mystery as to what you're to do next, and the 
<I>hunger</I> factor adds in even more frustration.  However, the simple novelty of this being true to the Dragon Ball 
storyline may be enough to some people.

<P>When you see a shell show up on the top of the screen, this means you can do a
Kamehameha.  To do this, hold down the <B>B button</B>, and then press <B>A button</B>.

The second game (translated as <I>Great Demon King's Revival</I>) introduces us not only to Piccolo Daimaou but also 
to the Battle Card system, used in the rest of the DB games for the NES.

<P>The game contains a unique <I>adventure</I> system when Gokuu is in various locales like the Kame House.  More 
specifically, Gokuu can maintain an inventory, search, talk, examine items, and move around in an area.  Through this, 
Gokuu and get clues and necessary items in order to proceed.  This, however, also means that Japanese knowledge is 
more necessary.

<P>As he finishes one area, the road ahead of him is protrayed as a game board, and Gokuu selects cards marked with 
numbers that act like dice.  As Gokuu lands on various spaces, Kamesennin asks him to pick from face-down cards; 
some are bonuses; some are mini-games.  However, a number of them are Piccolo cards which cause one of the 
Daimaou's hordes to fight you including his henchmen Cymbal and Tambourine.

<P>When Gokuu gets attacked, the battle cards are used once more; this time the object being is to deal the strongest 
cards.  The <I>fight</I> is shown in little animated panels, and the process is repeated until one person remains 
standing.

<I>The Legend of Gokuu</I> continues along the same vein as <I>Daimou Fukkatsu</I> in that the battle card system 
and the adventure/game board elements remain in this game.  However, the adventure element is toned down 
concentrating on battles which now look graphically better than the ones in part 2.  Also, Kamesennin no longer shows 
up between landing on spaces, and the board spaces now have icons.  Some lead to card games; some lead to instant 
battle.  There are now item cards to use (to up your HP, etc.), and other characters show up as Gokuu gets ready to
fight Piccolo Jr. in the Tenkaichi Budokai.

<I>Attack!  Saiyajin</I> follows Gokuu and Piccolo as they try to save Gohan from Radditz, then Garlick's attacks, and 
then concludes with a battle against Nappa and Vegeta.  This is a game using an improved version of the DB battle card 
system.  The graphics in this game have improved quite a bit as the battles are now <I>acted out</I>.  The adventure 
element is pretty much gone in this game, leaving a more RPG-ish feel to the game.  Other characters (Gohan, 
Piccolo, etc.) come under control and can all use their special attacks (such as the Kamehameha and Tenshinhan's 
body split).  You can fight more than one enemy at a time adding more challenge, but this also makes the game suspect 
to being <I>ganged up</I> on.

This game follows the chapter of DBZ where Gohan and gang need to get to Namek and find the Dragon Balls only to find 
Freeza on Namek.  The player must get to Namek, search for the Dragon Balls, fight the Ginyuu Squad, and finally face 
off with Freeza.  This game makes slight improvements upon the first game but brings back selecting a card after each 
move on the game board.  You may get an item card (such as Bulma, who increases your HP), or you'll get a Freeza card 
which means you'll get attacked.

<I>Fight to the Death Against the Cyborgs</I> has the most story and action of the 3 DBZ battle card games.  Goku needs 
to get to Namek, fight against Cyborg Freeza, unite the Dragon Balls, fight Coola, then Dr. Gero and his cyborgs, and 
THEN Cell!  The is thethird in the DBZ battle card games.  The fight scenes are sped up a bit, and the graphics again
are slightly improved.  Vegeta comes under control in this game.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">From Roger Nystrom:</H3>
<I>Dragon Ball Z Legends:  The Plan to Destroy the Saiyajins</I> is an original DBZ storyline as Dr. Raichi uses 
biogenetically engineered fighters to take over the world.  Goku, Gohan, and the Z Senshi witness the return of old 
baddies including Freeza!  Again, this is a battle card game featuring an auto-select function that's actually helpful.
The battle scenes go <B>extraordinarily</B>fast; the older DBZ card games had battle scenes that, after a while, 
became boring, and this extreme speed boost solves this.
