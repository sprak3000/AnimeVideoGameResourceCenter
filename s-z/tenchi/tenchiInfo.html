<PRE>
  After tricking his grandfather, Tenchi gets the keys to an old   
  shrine.  Family legend says that a hero defeated a horrific      
  demon long ago, and the demon was imprisoned here.  The hero's   
  sword was placed next to the demon to guard it.  Tenchi finds    
  the old sword...and a mummy.  Since Tenchi broke the seals, the  
  mummy rises.  Frantically, Tenchi tries to reseal the shrine and 
  escapes.  Later, Tenchi is back at school.  He is startled by a  
  girl who appears out of nowhere.  This is Ryouko, space pirate,  
  former mummy, and a VERY annoyed demon.  She decides to kill     
  Tenchi, 'cause she has to take it out on *someone*.  Tenchi      
  escapes from the destroyed school...to find that Ryouko has      
  decided to move in with him.  Things get REALLY interesting when 
  Aeka, Princess of the Jurai, comes to Earth looking for her      
  brother...the long-dead hero who sealed Ryouko up the first time.
  This is a very funny, fast-moving action comedy with lots of     
  unique elements...including spaceships grown from trees and a    
  pirate ship that becomes a cute bunny...                         

  NOTE: The title might also be translated as &quot;This Side Up,Tenchi&quot;
    and, in fact, is carried that way at Nikaku.  This is because  
    the kanji used can be interpreted more than one way...         

  NOTE: The rating for this entry is based less on how much I like 
    the series, and more on the fan reception that I saw at a con.
