The game has you running around avoiding enemies, but I don't know what 
the purpose of the game is.  You occasionally find doors that teleport you
to different parts of the playing field.

Gegege no Kitarou is an anime aimed for kids based on traditional Japanese

 including character graphics.

This is a combination war strategy game and scrolling shooter.  You control
Godzilla and Mothra as they move around a grid to gain position on the advancing
enemies.  Moving from square to square can cause you to enter a scrolling
shooting stage where you must destroy the enemy guns, ships, and other
objects.

It is your standard horizontal scrolling game with basically two types of game 
play.  In one type, you are walking around talking to agents to locate the evil 
"Condor".  Along the way, enemy agents pop up and attack you.  You start out 
with a kick as your only weapon, but you get a gun after defeating the first 
enemy agent you encounter.  The second type is a shooting gallery type view.  
Various enemy agents pop up, and you must aim your sniper's sight at them to 
kill them.

This is a horizontal-scrolling fighting game.  You control Ken(?) as he punches
and kicks his way through hordes of enemies.  I am fairly sure this is a
glitch caused by NESA, but you can never die (I have just stood there for 
10 minutes letting the enemies shoot and hit me).  Overall, the game is
weak (especially the ending), but it is one of the few NES games I know of that
show people exploding.

To proceed to the next level, keep walking left until you find a doorway
with a little girl standing in it (she will appear and then disappear).
At this doorway, press A+B+Up.  Keep doing this until you find the level boss.

This is basically the same game as the first one except the graphics are a lot
sharper.  It is not a spectacular game, but it is one of the few Nintendo games
where you get to see people explode.

This is a wrestling game.  NESA does not run this game well.  It chops up the
screen funny, but the game is still playable.  <I>Kinikuman</I> was released in
 the US as <I>Muscles</I>.  Beyond that, I do not know much about this anime.

This is a Mario-style platform game.  The characters should be familiar to you; the anime is know as <I>Samurai Pizza Cats</I> 
in the US.  Pressing <B>Start</B> will pause the game and let you choose which of the three characters you want to play
as.  Special weapons can be picked up along the way; to use them, press <B>Up + A</B>.  Tapping the directional pad 
twice and then holding it will make you run.

This game is based on the anime starring Toei's mascot Perrault (named after the author of <I>Puss 'n' Boots</I>).  This 
game is based very closely on the <I>Puss 'n' Boots</I> movie <I>Around the World in 80 Days</I> where you must 
make it around the world to win a bet using all different forms of transportation while avoiding cat guild asassins (they 
want to kill Perrault because he has mice for friends).  Fun game with lots of variety.  -- from Doug Cranston

This is a standard horizontal-scrolling shooter.  You pilot your Valkyrie as 
you blast countless swarms of enemy ships.  It has decent graphics and 
gameplay, but it is not an outstanding game.  To change the form of your
Valkyrie, press the <B>A button</B> + up/left/right.

This game is a side-scrolling action game where you control Optimus Prime and take on the Decepticons by yourself.
It is very unfair because you have a weak weapon, can only take one hit, and have no continues.  -- from Doug Cranston

This is a horizontal-scrolling platform game.  You have to guide Lum to her 
wedding with Ataru.  You start at Infant School, move on to Elementary School, 
then Junior High School, High School, the Studio and finally the Chapel.  Lum 
grows along the way, until she becomes the woman we know.  In the last stage, 
the Chapel, Lum will be wearing a weddingdress.  This stage is different from 
the others, because you can't fire electricity, and you can't duck! You have to
 collect wedding-items (flowers, rings, necklaces etc.) while dodging enemies.
When you succeed, Lum and Ataru will get married and the game will start over 
again.  -- from Patriek Lesparre (list below as well)

<LI> Jariten comes to help you; he flies above you shooting fireballs at the

<LI> You become Rei and all enemies turn into fish that you can eat (extra
points!).  You need to be in this state in the later levels to reach the roof!
<LI> Bonus Game:  big Cherry-heads fly around the screen and you get
bonus points for shooting them.  You can really fly as well!
<LI> Teleports:  you will be teleported to another place on the same floor.
<LI> Switches:   to switch on moving platforms.

of hits.
