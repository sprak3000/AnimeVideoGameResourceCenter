The first 16-bit system ever was released to the Japanese market in 1988.
NEC revealed the PC-Engine and has continued to modify and upgrade it to
this day.  In 1990, NEC released the PC-Engine to the US market calling 
it the Turbo Graphx-16.  While the Turbo Graphx barely made a dent in the 
market at that time, it has seen a revival of late as many people 
discover the power of this system.  This system has also released a wide 
variety of anime-based games.  <A HREF="http://www.amug.org/~bobfra/engine.html" TARGET="_top">A more complete 
history of the PC-Engine</A> can be found at the <I>Un-official Turbo Pages</I>.

<P>

The Turbo Graphx-16 had a territorial lockout like most game systems.  An 
adaptor could be bought to play PC-Engine games on the Turbo Graphx-16; 
however, the PC-Engine has no way of playing Turbo Graphx-16 games.  A 
complete explanation of compatibility and more is found in the

Graphx-16/Duo FAQ</A>.
