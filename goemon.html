I believe this is the game series listed as "Charge Goemon" in Ken Arromdee's
list.  This is a Zelda-style game where you run around bashing enemies and
buying supplies to reach your goal; unfortunately, I have no idea what the
goal is.  Decent graphics still don't cover the weak gameplay though.

This is exactly like the Gameboy game above, but it has color.  Other than
that, there appears to be no difference except that the levels may be set
up differently.  Haven't been able to play both games yet to see if the levels 
differ.
