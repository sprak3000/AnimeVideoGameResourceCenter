This is a war-strategy game for the Game Gear.  Haven't played it enough to 
understand how it works.

This appears to be a Gundam-based game.  I didn't find it in Ken Arromdee's 
list, but the mecha appear to be from Gundam.  You basically run around on a
battle field shooting your opponents.

<IMG SRC="images/MSX/gun_msx.gif" ALT="[Mobile Suit Gundam:  Last Shooting]" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=212>
This is a multi-level game where each level has a different objective.  The
first level has your character dodge falling debris before entering his mobile
suit.  The second level has you shooting other mechs and gun emplacements.
Haven't played it past the second level.

This is the typical Gundam war strategy simulation.  You pick your officers
and troops and try to beat your opponent.  To play this game under fMSX,
you must copy the file to the drivea.dsk file in your fMSX directory.  Make
sure there are no carta.rom files in that directory; from there, you should
just be able to start fmsx without any ROM files listed on the command line,
and the game should boot right up.

This appears to be a Zelda-style RPG.  Haven't played it much yet.

This appears to be a war-strategy game.  Haven't been able to figure out how
to play it much yet.
