<PRE>
  In the futuristic metropolis of Olympus, a terrorist action is   
  taking place.  Handling the situation is ESWAT, a special branch 
  of the Olympus Police Dept.  Through the tense situation, ESWAT  
  prepares to neutralize the terrorists.  Finally, ESWAT strikes   
  and kill or capture all but one of the terrorists.  Along the    
  way, we're introduced to two ESWAT members: Deunan Nut and       
  Briareos Hecatonchires.  They are 2 outsiders who joined ESWAT   
  for lack of anywhere else to go.  The OAV tells a story of a     
  terrorist plot to take over Gaia...the central computer running  
  Olympus.  The plot involves a disillusioned ESWAT officer and    
  the terrorist who got away and Hitomi, Deunan's bioroid friend   
  who is used as a pawn to gain access to Gaia.                    
								   
  NOTE: The OAV is based on the manga &quot;Appleseed&quot; by Matsumune     
    Shirow.  The manga is full of rich character development and   
    background.  Unfortunately, none of this was shown in the OAV. 
    We got a simple police vs. terrorist story filled with lots of 
    action, but was pretty pointless.  It was interesting to see   
    how many English words were misspelled, though... :-)
