you walk around fighting people until you reach the level boss. You have a spirit meter, but I haven't played the game enough to figure 
out how to pull of any special moves. 

<p>While the fighting sequences and graphics aren't that impressive, I find the concept of the game interesting. Figuring out the special moves 
and finding out where the stories are going will keep you busy for awhile.
