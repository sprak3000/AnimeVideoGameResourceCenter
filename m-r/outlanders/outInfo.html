<H3>Description:</H3>
<PRE>
 While invading the Sacred Planet (Earth), Princess Kahm destroys 
  an army unit, but is unexpectedly defeated by a photographer     
  named Tetsuya who's covering the invasion.  Kahm promptly does   
  three things: kisses him, kidnaps him and plans to marry him.    
  On the way back, she finds that many are opposed to the marriage 
  (which, as a side benefit, is supposed to save Earth) including  
  her father.  Tetsuya rescues her, and they try to elope.  This   
  OAV attempted to cram the entire manga into 1 hour and comes     
  out confused...but it's still fun, nevertheless.
