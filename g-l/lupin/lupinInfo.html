<PRE>
  One of the greatest thieves in the world is a man known as Lupin.
  Once he gets his sights on something valuable, nothing can stop  
  the theft.  Along with his gang, Lupin travels the world in      
  search of loot.  In his wake is the Interpol Inspector Zenigata  
  who will stop at almost nothing to capture Lupin. As the two men 
  match wits against each other, we are treated to some truly      
  enjoyable &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot; stories...often in an action-comedy 
  vein.  Naturally, Lupin is the one who usually comes out on top. 
  The blotter reads as follows:

    Arsene Lupin III: The head man.  Grandson of the famous French 
      thief Arsene Lupin, Lupin does his best to live up to his    
      grandfather's reputation.  He is an ingenious thief with a   
      streak of morality and honor.

    Jigen Daisuke: Lupin's right-hand man. Jigen looks and dresses 
      like a 1930's era mobster and is a dead shot with his        
      beloved revolver.  Formally an enforcer with a Chicago mob,  
      Jigen got into trouble, so he left for Japan and changed his 
      name.  He is Lupin's confidant and best friend.

    Goemon Ishikawa: A descendant of a Japanese thief of the same  
      name, Goemon is the archtypical samurai.  He has an austure  
      life style and shuns women.  With his discipline, he can     
      perform amazing feats with his sword, though he considers it 
      dishonorable to cut non-living things...something that seems 
      to be common while he hangs around Lupin.

    Fujiko Miine: She is not really a member of Lupin's group.  A  
      mercenary by trade, she often has her own thing going and    
      often uses her devastating physical proportions for her own  
      advantage. She calls upon Lupin only for a) help if she gets 
      in over her head or b) if she needs a dupe to take the blame.
      Fujiko often competes for the same targets as Lupin.  Some-  
      times, Fujiko even *helps* Lupin!

    Koichi Zenigata: A descendant of a famous Edo-period Japanese  
      Policeman (well, why not? :-)), Zenigata is charged to catch 
      Lupin.  He has been given carte blanche by Interpol to use   
      any method necessary.  He is a completely incorruptible cop  
      who has an amazing skill with handcuffs.  He is also a sharp 
      detective whose only failing is that Lupin is better.  Both  
      men share a grudging respect for each other.
                                                                   
  Legal note: &quot;Arsene Lupin&quot; is a trademark owned by the estate of 
    Maurice LeBlanc (who wrote the original novels).  Permission   
    was never given for use outside of Japan, so that is why US    
    releases use different names (i.e. &quot;Rupan&quot; for AnimEigo and    
    &quot;Wolf&quot; for Streamline Pictures).
