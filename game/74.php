<p>This game has a section of exploration. In this RPG-like section, you have to move Doraemon into Nobita's town and speak with the people that he meets in the streets or in the houses. Even though the dialogue is all in japanese, you will know something important is being said when you hear a bell. At this point, if you push
<strong>Start</strong>, you will see a flashing point on the map that represents a platform section. At the beginning of the game, you are able to control only Doraemon but later in the
game you can control the Nobitas and others. In the platform levels, your character can jump on enemies or use special weapons to defeat them. There are many things to find in the levels, but it is important to collect the 12 bells to complete the game. I don't know much about the story, but a little fairy has come from another world looking for help. - Matteo Fancellu</p>		</td>
