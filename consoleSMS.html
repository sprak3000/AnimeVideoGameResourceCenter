In 1986, Sega decided to challenge Nintendo's growing hold on the video
game industry.  The Sega Master System was released and was considered
technically superior to the NES.  Despite being technically superior in
hardware, the SMS suffered when it came to software.  Nintendo's earlier 
release date to a video-game starved market and their policy of having 
third-party developers only develop for the NES prevented the SMS from
achieving a large user base.

<P>That does not mean that great software wasn't developed for the SMS.  One
of the most respected RPG games ever was <I>Phantasy Star</I>.  This SMS
game was an instant classic and spawned many sequels.  In 1990, Sega 
released the Sega Master System II.  This was a scaled-down version of the
SMS aimed at gathering a larger user base through inexpensive hardware.
Those that did not want to buy the Sega Genesis could now buy the previous
system at a cheap price.

<P>Sega did not implement a territorial lockout on the SMS.  All Japanese
and European games could be played on the system.  Master System games 
could also be played on the Genesis through the <I>Power Base Convertor</I>.
By using the <I>Master Gear</I> convertor, you could play some of the
Master System games on your Game Gear as well.
