The game has 8 stages. To finish a stage you have to find the two rings 
and the exit.  There are a number of items to be found, like bullets and 
flashlights.  In the top of the screen is a bar called <B>Cup</B>; when you 
pick up green (small) or red (big) cups of noodles it'll grow. When you 
find a hotwater-kettle your life will be (partially) renewed, depending 
on the amount of CUP aquired.

<P><B>Stage 1:</B>  First of all, hit all goatheads (some contain hidden 
items).  One of the hidden items is a rocket with a rope attached so 
you'll be able to go up in the upper room. Stand under the recess in the 
wall and press UP and A-button (spacebar). The rocket is now launched and
your a level higher.  Stand under the big goathead and jump (with B-button
or GRAPH-key).

<P><B>Stage 2:</B>  Hit all the busts to open the trap-door in the rightmost 
room. Of course, you'll have to hit all the goatheads too. There are also 
hidden items behind the lights. In the cellar, hit the chests on the left 
for extra items. At the big goathead, go up (you found another rocket if 
you've done everything right), take everything and go back to the goathead
and jump under it.  In principle all the other stages are finished 
similarly.

<LI> Pressing <B>Up + B-button</B> (GRAPH-key) will change your bubble-ammo. 
The special ammo can be aquired by killing enemies.
<LI> When you fall in the room with the flames, you must destroy the 
flames by shooting bubbles at them, when you hold out long enough you'll 
get a reward and be bounced back up again.
<LI> Items will pop up when you pass certain points or jump at the right 
places.  Some of these will start a bonus game with Jigen or Goemon.
