This is a combination war strategy game and scrolling shooter.  You control
Godzilla and Mothra as they move around a grid to gain position on the advancing
enemies.  Moving from square to square can cause you to enter a scrolling
shooting stage where you must destroy the enemy guns, ships, and other
objects.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Godzilla (VGB)</H2>
<IMG SRC="images/GB/godzila.gif" ALT="[Godzilla]" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=144>
This is a puzzle game where you must guide a cute looking Godzilla (who looks
remarkably similar to the main character from <I>Bubble Bobble</I>) from stage
to stage.  Each puzzle seems to consist of dodging the creatures chasing you
while trying to break or position the rocks to solve the puzzle.
