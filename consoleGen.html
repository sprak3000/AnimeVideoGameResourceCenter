Sega scored a big hit against Nintendo in 1989 by releasing the Sega Genesis.
The Genesis was the second 16-bit game system to appear (the PC-Engine in 
Japan being the first).  The Genesis was known as the Mega Drive in Japan.  The
Genesis did not make a large dent in the Japanese market, but the US market 
made it a solid contender against Nintendo.

<P>The language lock-out on the Genesis involves a built-in language switch and megahertz settings in the Megadrive (the
Japanese version of the Genesis).  Since the Genesis has neither of these, your only hope is to build a language switch 
and cut plastic from your Genesis to make the cartrige fit or buy a converter with a language switch.  Many Genesis 
games contain the roms for their Japanese counterparts, such as <I>Mystic Defender (Kujaku-Ou)</I>.  If a language
switch is set to <I>Japanese</I>, it plays the original game.  -from Doug Cranston
