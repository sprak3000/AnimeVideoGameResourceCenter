<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Quake Patches</H3>
If you haven't heard, <I>Quake</I> is the successor to <I>Doom</I>.  It is
gorier and has superb graphics.  Beyond that, it is still pretty much just
like playing <I>Doom</I>.  Since <I>Quake</I> hasn't been around too long,
there aren't many patches for it yet.  But here are few that people have
been working to make.
