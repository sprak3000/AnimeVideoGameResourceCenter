I have been receiving numerous emails asking me <I>&quot;Where can I find this game?&quot;</I>.  So, I thought I would
use this page as a starting point for people looking to add import games to their collections.  Before purchasing
an import game, check out my page on <A HREF="lockout.html">territorial lock outs</A> to see what you might have to do
to your system to play an import game.

<P>This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of import game dealers; if you want to look for more, try plugging
in <I>import video game</I> into a search engine.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">www.ebay.com</H3>
<A HREF="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</A> is an online auctioning service; anyone can put an item up for
sale or bid on an item.  People who buy and sell on Ebay have feedback ratings associated with them; by
checking a person's feedback rating, you can see what others have said about their experiences with that
person.  You can always find plenty of import games for sale; I have personally purchased several import
games through auctions (including my precious copy of the Lupin game for the Super Famicom).

<P><H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Tronix</H3>
<A HREF="http://www.tronixweb.com/">Tronix</A> is an excellent import dealer based out of New York.
They have a wide range of import games available for the latest systems but few for the older systems.
In my experiences with them, their customer service has been exceptional and delivery was fast.  Pre-orders
for upcoming games can be made as well.  Can't wait long for your game to arrive?  Tronix offers a wide range
of shipping options.  Overall, Tronix is the one import store on the net that I trust.

<P><H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Some Other Places to Try</H3>
If you follow any of the video game newsgroups, you will eventually come across a thread saying
<I><A HREF="http://www.buyrite1.com/">Buy-Rite</A> screwed me!</I>  This thread appears regularly.  I have never 
dealt with them personally; so, I cannot comment from personal experience.  Looking at their web site, they have a 
good inventory list of games at great prices, but the shipping evens the price out to most prices you see at other
stores on the net.  Buyer beware!

<P><A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/ga/stridersgames/index.html">SDX Video Games &amp; Anime Home Page</A> is
a small dealer on the net.  While the inventory list is not large, they can track down a lot of games that you cannot find
at other import dealers.  Have purchased some games through them; expect to pay retail prices though you can get
a good deal from time to time.

<P>Finally, here are some other stores that I have looked at but not dealt with personally.  They intrigued me so I 
thought I would include them.
