<em>The Mystery of Mamo</em>; only 550 machines were made making the laserdisc from the game a rare collectible.  Using the joystick and two action buttons (one for your hands and one for your feet), you made various choices of what Cliff (Lupin) should do as the action unfolds before you.  Jumper settings inside the machine allowed on-screen hints to appear.</p>
