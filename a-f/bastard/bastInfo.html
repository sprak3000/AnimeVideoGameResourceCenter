<H3>Description:</H3>
<PRE>
  Some time in the future, the world has become a desolute place.  
  Great sorceries have been discovered, and warlords conquer all   
  in their path.  A mysterious magician named Abigail is in search 
  of the magical seals needed to reawaken a great demon.  One of   
  the seals is located in the peaceful kingdom of Metallicana.  In 
  desperation, Geo, the chief cleric, makes the decision to free   
  a dangerously powerful sorceror called Dark Schneider.  15 years 
  ago, Dark Schneider was conquering the world when he was stopped 
  by Geo and some other clerics and sealed in a little boy named   
  Rushe.  Now Geo's daughter, Yoko, becomes the key to his freedom 
  (since she is still a virgin).  Once he is free, Dark Schneider  
  can use his powers to save the kingdom.  However, Dark Schneider 
  has different ideas of how he wants to use his newfound freedom. 
  This is a fantasy adventure which explores a world without our   
  concept of modern technology, but which has embraced the powers  
  of magic.  It's also a story about Dark Schneider and how this   
  all-conquering sorceror has changed after 15 years of being      
  sealed inside a little boy who loves Yoko.  Lots of action.      
  What the title has to do with anything is anyone's guess... :-)
