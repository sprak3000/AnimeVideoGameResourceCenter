actually engage the enemy. When you do, your player is shown is semi first person perspective. In the first person perspective, 
you are riding your monocycle. As the enemies approach you, you have to destroy them using your monocycles weapon. The 
enemies can also fire at you. Left and right allow you do maneuver around the playing field and pressing up and the fire button 
allows you to aim up so that you can shoot at the aircraft. If you are not killed by the enemies or kill all of them then at the end of a minute, you are returned to the 
strategy board. Your personnel carriers can also attack the enemies but that portion is not interactive. - Gabriel Jarero		</td>
