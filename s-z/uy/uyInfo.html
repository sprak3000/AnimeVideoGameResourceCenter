<H3>Description:</H3>
<PRE>
  One day, an alien fleet appeared and was going to invade the     
  Earth.  Earth had only once chance: if a randomly selected Earth-
  man defeated an alien in a game of tag, then Earth would be      
  spared.  The computers picked a high school lech named Ataru     
  Moroboshi.  When Ataru found out, he hid behind his girlfriend   
  Shinobu...until he saw his opponent: a cute girl in a tiger-     
  striped bikini named Lum.  All he has to do is grab Lum's horns  
  before 10 days are up.  The horny Ataru was *very* willing to do 
  just that :-).  On the first day, Ataru dashed toward Lum...who  
  flew off.  Ataru screamed that nobody told him that Lum could    
  *fly*!  Day after day, Ataru kept trying and failing.  On the    
  last night, Shinobu said that she'd marry Ataru if he won.  The  
  next day, Ataru cheated...and won the match.  *Then* he said he  
  would now be married.  Baaaad timing...Lum took it to mean that  
  he wanted to marry *her*.  Now, the girl-chasing Ataru has a     
  devoted and loving 'wife' who will fry him if he even looks at   
  another girl.  Oh, didn't I mention Lum's electric shock power?  
  A romantic comedy created by the talented Rumiko Takahashi.
