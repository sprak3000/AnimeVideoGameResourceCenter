<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">MSX</H3>
In 1982, a Z80-based family of machines known as the MSX was introduced.
While gaining popularity in Asia, South America, the former Soviet Union,
 and Europe, the MSX remained virtually unknown in the US until the 
emulation scene revived interest in it.  The whole MSX project was designed
to establish a single home computing standard similar to the VHS standard
for video equipment.  The MSX standard was developed by a company called
ASCII in cooperation with Microsoft (rumor has it MSX stands for "MicroSoft 
eXtended").  A hard-wired version of Microsoft's BASIC was built into the
MSX machine.  Before its demise in 1988, the MSX2, MSX2+, and TurboR
versions were created.  A <A HREF="gamesMSX.html#msxList" TARGET="_self">partial list of anime-based MSX games</A> has been compiled.
