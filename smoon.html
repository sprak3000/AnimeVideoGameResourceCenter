Sailor Moon S is a game where you travel through each stage as Sailor
Moon or Sailor Chibi-Moon and kill the bad guys.  You will receive a sword
on the first stage completed in a land.  In the second stage, you will
receive a mirror.  In the third and final stage of a land, you must find a
heart shaped "locket" with a red gem inside.  The special moves for each 
character can be done by holding down the kick button for a longer than usual 
period of time.

<P>

When you get far enough into the third stage and have found the "locket", you 
will teleport into the lair of the boss.  If you are Sailor Moon, you will 
become Super Sailor Moon.  You will stay the same if you are Sailor Chibi-Moon.
  You must kill a few regular bad guys until the boss appears. When the boss is
 killed, you will have the chance to get a bonus weapon (that you can activate 
by holding down the kick button for a long time), in a bonus level.  -- from

This game follows the story line of Sailor Moon from the very beginning to
the end of the first story(?).  You must guide Usagi around various places
and talk to various people.  Once you have talked to the right combination of
people, you will transform into Sailor Moon and enter a horizontal-scrolling
action sequence.  You must fight your way through the bad guys to get to the
level boss(es).  Once you defeat the level boss(es), you go to the next level
to begin the process over again.

<P>

The graphics are fair, but the action is very limited.  Your only attack is
a pathetic looking kick.  There is no password or save feature for this game.
You can continue, but it takes you all the way back to the beginning of the
level.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Sailor Moon R (VGB)</H2>
<IMG SRC="images/GB/sm_r_cap.gif" ALT="[Sailor Moon R]" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=143>
This is a action and puzzle game.  The first part of each level has your
character walking around talking to people and playing games of chance.
Eventually, you will do all the actions necessary to proceed to the action
portion.  It is your basic side-scrolling, "shoot-em-up" action sequence.
The game has a lot of dialogue but very little replay value.

After pressing any button at the intro. screen, you will be presented with
four choices.  From playing the game, the choices are set up in this manner:
