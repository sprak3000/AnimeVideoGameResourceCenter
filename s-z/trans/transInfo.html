<H3>Description: </H3>
<PRE>
  On the planet Cybertron, the life forms are robots that are    
  able to transform into other machinery.  There was a war between 
  2 factions, and the Deceptacons won.  The Autobots retreated to  
  the planet Earth, led by Optimas Prime.  As the name implies,    
  Autobots can transform into motor vehicles with Prime becoming a 
  18-wheel truck.  The Deceptacons pursued the Autobots to Earth   
  led by Megatron, who transforms into a gun.  Most of the other   
  Deceptacons transform into jets.  The war continues on Earth.    
  The &quot;Transformers Movie&quot; ends this war with the Autobots winning,
  but having to face a planet-eating robot called Omicron Theta... 
  (This, of course, generates many toys for Hasbro to sell... :-)) 
								   
  Note: Despite the giant robots, this is an American creation and 
    production.  The concept proved popular in Japan, however, and 
    a new anime Transformers series ran there with original        
    stories, using Japanese writers and voice actors...
