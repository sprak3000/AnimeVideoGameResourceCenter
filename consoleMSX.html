In 1982, a Z80-based family of machines known as the MSX was introduced.
While gaining popularity in Asia, South America, the former Soviet Union,
 and Europe, the MSX remained virtually unknown in the US until the 
emulation scene revived interest in it.  The whole MSX project was designed
to establish a single home computing standard similar to the VHS standard
for video equipment.  The MSX standard was developed by a company called
ASCII in cooperation with Microsoft (rumor has it MSX stands for <I>MicroSoft eXtended</I>).  
A hard-wired version of Microsoft's BASIC was built into the MSX machine.  Before its demise 
in 1988, the MSX2, MSX2+, and TurboR versions were created.
