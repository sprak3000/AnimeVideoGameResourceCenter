<p>There are some other carnival games that you can play as well. The game has some humorous power-ups; one power-up turns you into a chicken that can throw eggs at the enemy. While the gameplay is not difficult, this game is cute and funny enough to hold your attention for awhile.</p>

<p>Turbo Mode: Enter the password <strong>SHINCHANTURBO</strong> in hiragana. In other words, 
(shi)(n)(cha)(n)(ta)(a)(bo)). There will be a space or two left over, but the 
password will work. I haven't completely tested it, but it seems to start you 
off on level 5 with faster speed. - Mike Koos</p>		</td>
