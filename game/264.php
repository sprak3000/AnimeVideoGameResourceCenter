					<ul>						<li>Basketball cards</li>					</ul>			</ul>This is a basketball game based on the popular anime. It isn't a pure basketball game though; it uses a strange card system to make your plays. A card allows you to 
pass, shoot, or dribble around a person. I don't know enough Japanese to figure out what card does what. The game allows you to go through a story mode(?) or 
just play a single game.		</td>
