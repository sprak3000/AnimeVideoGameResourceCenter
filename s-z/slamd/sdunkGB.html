This is a basketball game based on the popular anime.  It isn't a pure 
basketball game though; it uses a strange card system to make your plays.  A
card allows you to pass, shoot, or dribble around a person.  I don't know 
enough Japanese to figure out what card does what.  The game allows you to go
through a story mode(?) or just play a single game.

This is a basketball game based on the popular anime.  It is easier to 
play than the first one was, but the controls still take some practice to understand them.  
You see a top view of the court with all your players listed as numbered 
circles.  The player with the ball is a completely solid circle.  When you shoot, 
you are given a bar with a moving cursor.  You hit the shoot button again when 
it is in the dark band of the bar for a more accurate shot.  There are other times when 
you confront an opposing player and must dribble or pass around him, or you are 
defending against an opposing player and must try to steal the ball or stop 
him from going around you.
