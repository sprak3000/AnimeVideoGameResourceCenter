Fujiko has been kidnapped by Mamo, and it is up to Lupin and the gang to get
her back.

<p>Player one is Lupin while player 2 is Jigen.  There are fifteen stages total that
take you through car chases and shootouts.  Gameplay is what you expect for the
shootout levels.  The car chase levels require precise shooting; pulling the trigger
on your gun will control the movement of your car.

<p>The official site for the game can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031210093804/http://www.wow-ent.co.jp/product/lupin3rdshooting/index.html">here</a>.		</td>
