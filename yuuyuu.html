This game is a street fighter game with two different story modes and a
versus mode.  In the story modes, you progress along a path fighting various
enemies.  You get to choose from different characters to fight as depending
on where you are in the story.  During the fight, you have three "spirit
points" at your disposal.  You use these buy holding down the punch button
to charge you spirit meter.  When the spirit meter is fully charged, release
the punch button, and your spirit attack will be unleashed.

<P>

The graphics are good, and the game play is better than most Gameboy games.
The fighting isn't as complex or challenging as most games these days, but
it is an entertaining game.

<IMG SRC="images/GB/yuu2_cap.gif" ALT="[Yuu Yuu Hakusho 2]" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=144>
This is your standard street fighting game.  You can choose from the story
mode, team battle mode, or versus battle mode.

<P>

In the story mode, you control a team of five characters in the Underworld
tournament.  Before each battle, you can choose which character to use and how
much "power" and "spirit" he has in reserve.  There are two bonus games during
the tournament that allow you to increase the amount of "power" and "spirit"
available.

<BR CLEAR="LEFT">

<P>

The team battle mode allows you to choose five characters from any of the
characters in the game.  Your team will then face a computer or second player
controlled team of five players to see who is the best team.

<P>

After playing the game a few times, you can pick up on the right character and
strategy to beat each opponent.  The order of the tournament opponents never
changes, so the only replay value comes from trying to figure out how to do
each character's special moves.

<P>

After pressing any button at the intro. screen, you will be presented with
four choices.  From playing the game, the choices are set up in this manner:

This game is part Zelda RPG, part side-scrolling fighting game.  You move
around the city talking to various characters.  After talking to the right
people or finding the right item, you enter an area where you walk around
fighting people until you reach the level boss.  You have a spirit meter,
but I haven't played the game enough to figure out how to pull of any
special moves.

<P>

While the fighting sequences and graphics aren't that impressive, I find
the concept of the game interesting.  Figuring out the special moves and
finding out where the stories are going will keep you busy for awhile.

This game really shows off what the Gameboy can do.  It returns to the
fighting style of Yuu Yuu Hakusho 2.  The backgrounds and graphics are superb.
You can choose from the story mode, versus mode, and an amusing mode where
the women from Yuu Yuu Hakusho basically try to hit each other with bats
more times than their opponent.
