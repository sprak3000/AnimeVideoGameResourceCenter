# Anime Video Game Resource Center Web Site
This is the source code for the [Anime Video Game Resource Center](https://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/avrc/). You can
fork it, install it on your own server, and have a complete reproduction of the site as it was on 2001 August 21. The
site is distributed via the [MIT license](https://github.com/sprak3000/AnimeVideoGameResourceCenter/blob/master/LICENSE).
If you do host your own version, please acknowledge this repository as the original source.

## Installation

This version of the site was built to be run on a server with PHP 3.X and MySQL (version lost to the mists of time)
installed. It was designed to pass along IDs in the query string and pull data out for display. The database behind it
and the configuration file have been lost rendering this version useful only as a reference for what PHP looked like
at the time.

## Additional Details

This version of the site also featured a bespoke CMS to manage the data via the code in the `/cms` directory. The 
`/video` directory holds some old [RealMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealMedia) files. There might be some way
still to play them, but no efforts on my part have been made to do so. Image assets for the site were built using
[PaintShop Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro) and can be found in the `/psp` directory. Again, there
might be some way to open and use them, but no efforts on my part have been made to do so.
