In September of 1995, Sony entered the the videogame market with their 32-bit Playstation.  The
CD-based gaming system fought against the Sega Saturn for the title of
<I>Greatest Next Generation Gaming System</I>.  Slick polygon-based games drew
the attention of many a gamer.  Sony also struck a major blow against
both Sega and Nintendo when SquareSoft decided that the PSX would be the
platform <I>Final Fantasy 7</I> would appear on.

<P>

In 1997, Sony dropped the price of the PSX to $149.99 and the price of
games down to $49.99 when the Nintendo 64 was released over the Christmas
holiday.  Despite this wonderful price reduction, the Playstation contains
the feature that gamers hate, territorial lockout.  Sony decided to follow
the rest of the videogame companies and not let US Playstations play
Japanese games.  A quick response came from Hong Kong.  People there found
out that old model Playstations could overcome this by swapping disks.
Essentially, you would start the Playstation with a US title in it.  Then,
you would use something to hold down the button that tells the PSX that 
the CD door is closed.  While the US game is booting up, you quickly swap
the US disk with your Japanese disk.  If done correctly, you could now
play a Japanese game.  There were some drawbacks; many games would not
display graphics correctly or would not play the music correctly.

<P>Sony did not like this at all.  Future PSX models had the component 
removed that allowed swapping to work at all.  Once again, Hong Kong came
up with a solution.  They figured out how to make the chip that would 
allow any PSX to play any game.  It effectively canceled out the PSX's
check of the country code etched onto the CD being played.  These chips
became known as <I>mod chips</I>.  Various versions are floating around
ranging from eight-pin to four-pin chips.  Installing a <I>mod chip</I>
will allow you to play US, Japanese, and UK CDs on a single PSX system.

<P>Where can you get one you ask?  Well, there are many people selling them
on the internet; the catch is you have to know how to solder it onto the
PSX board yourself.  Too afraid that you will mess something up?  Then
the <A HREF="http://www.lightlink.com/orb/psxact.htm">PSX Activator</A>
from Silicon Orb is what you need.  For $45, they will install and test
the <I>mod chip</I> into your PSX and ship it back to you (of course, you
also have to pay to ship your PSX to them).  For $18, they will just ship
the <I>mod chip</I> to you with wires pre-soldered onto the chip as well
as providing detailed instructions on how to install it.
