This is a horizontal-scrolling shooter where you control a bat-winged boy.
The enemies you face all seem to be objects that have come alive.  Fire
extinguishers will shoot balls of deadly water at you.  Pencils and paper
airplanes will attack you.  I don't know anything about the series, but
the game feels like a cute version of <I>Parodius</I>.
