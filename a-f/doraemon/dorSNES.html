This game has a section of exploration. In this RPG-like section, you have to move 
Doraemon into Nobita's town and speak with the people that he meets in the streets or in the houses.  Even though the
dialogue is all in japanese, you will know something important is being said when you hear a bell.  At this point, if you 
push <B>Start</B>, you will see a flashing point on the map that represents a platform section.  At the beginning of the 
game, you are able to control only Doraemon but later in the game you can control the Nobitas and others.  In the 
platform levels, your character can jump on enemies or use special weapons to defeat them.  There are many things to 
find in the levels, but it is important to collect the 12 bells to complete the game.  I don't know much about the story, but 
a little fairy has come from another world looking for help.

This game is very similar to the first game.  Now you can choose which character to use at the beginning of each level.
Everyone has a different ability; you can also choose Doramichiyan, a female cat that looks like Doraemon.  The 
platform levels are longer and a little bit harder than the ones of the first episode.

In this game, it seems Doraemon is taking his friend on some sort of time-traveling tour (possibly to get information for
an upcoming school assignment?).

You can choose from six characters before each level.  Picking up a certain item causes another 
character to hop on your back.  There are blocks in the level that bear the face of a certain 
character.  Somehow, this specific character plays a part in finishing a level.
