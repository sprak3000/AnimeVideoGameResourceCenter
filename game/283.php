This is a yet another wacky puzzle game loaded with extreme cuteness.  You can choose from a single player game, a
VS CPU game, and a two player VS game.  The object of the puzzle is to clear your area of blocks.  You clear blocks
when there are two blocks next to each other that are the same color.  All blocks of the same color that are right next 
to each other are removed in long chains if you are lucky.  While you are trying to do this, blocks and special items
fall down onto your stack.  Some items will remove a row of blocks while others will just blow up a few blocks near it.

<P>As you clear the blocks, horizontal space becomes available and all blocks will move toward empty space depending on
the direction of the arrow to the side of your stack.  By pressing <strong>X</strong>, you can change the direction the blocks will
move.  This becomes useful when you have a lot of space horizontally; you can position your stack in the best place for
the blocks currently falling down.  In VS games, your opponent can perform special attacks that can drop black blocks
onto your stack.  The only way to remove black blocks is to destroy a string of blocks right next to them.		</td>
