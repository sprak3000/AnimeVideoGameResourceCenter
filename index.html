<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Code Freeze</H1>
This site has undergone a massive code freeze.  <B>No</B>, I repeat, <B>NO</B> new
updates will be posted to the site until I have completed the revamping
of the site.  A completely new <I>Anime Videogame Resource Center</I> will
open up in March of 1998.  It will have a new look and feel plus more 
information.

<P>Until then, please <B>do not</B>, I repeat,  <B>DO NOT</B> send me any email with
information.  I will have my hands full with just trying to rework the
pages without losing any of the existing information.  Once the site is
back to normal, you can mail me any information you have.  As always,
any emails asking "Could you send me game X?" will be sent directly to 
/dev/null, your name passed on to my gremlins who will plague your system,
and your name forever cursed.

<P>We now return you to our <A HREF="frames/index.html">regularly scheduled site.</A>
