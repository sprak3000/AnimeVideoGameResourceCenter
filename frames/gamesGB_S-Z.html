This is a action and puzzle game.  The first part of each level has your
character walking around talking to people and playing games of chance.
Eventually, you will do all the actions necessary to proceed to the action
portion.  It is your basic side-scrolling, "shoot-em-up" action sequence.
The game has a lot of dialogue but very little replay value.

This is a puzzle game.  You guide Lupin to find the treasure on the level.
You must avoid Zenigata and other enemies; along the way you can find help
from Jigen, etc.

<P>

The graphics are not that great, but the puzzles are interesting to solve.
Overall, it is not a very good game (but I like it because I am a HUGE Lupin 
fan).

This is a basketball game based on the popular anime.  It isn't a pure 
basketball game though; it uses a strange card system to make your plays.  A
card allows you to pass, shoot, or dribble around a person.  I don't know 
enough Japanese to figure out what card does what.  The game allows you to go
through a story mode(?) or just play a single game.

This is a basketball game based on the popular anime.  It is easier to 
play than the first one was, but the controls still take some practice to understand them.  
You see a top view of the court with all your players listed as numbered 
circles.  The player with the ball is a completely solid circle.  When you shoot, 
you are given a bar with a moving cursor.  You hit the shoot button again when 
it is in the dark band of the bar for a more accurate shot.  There are other times when 
you confront an opposing player and must dribble or pass around him, or you are 
defending against an opposing player and must try to steal the ball or stop 
him from going around you.

This is a horizontal-scrolling, platform game.  You start out with your trusty
spear.  By holding the <B>B button</B> down for a while, you can throw your
spear at an enemy.  You must then pick up your spear to use it or wait a minute
for it to automatically return.  Without your spear, your weapon is a whip with
a blade on the end.  It can hurt enemies but not as much as the spear.  The whip
can also be used while jumping to grab the ceiling.  The "Power List" brings up
a list of Tekkaman powers you can use.  They range from jet boosters to the
powerful Tekkaman cannons.  While you move around the level, your energy builds
up allowing you to choose different powers.  Using a power will drain the energy
meter.  To jump higher than normal, hold down before jumping.

The intro starts with Ataru and Lum walking/flying to school saying they should
 hurry up, but when they get there Megane comes running screaming:  "Ataru! 
It's WEIRD! Look over there!"  There is a plaque are which says something about
 a Miss-contest, and what I understand is that Lum will compete...

In the game you are Ataru. You wander about through the halls of Tomobiki
Highschool fighting Urusei Yatsura characters like Lum's Stormtroopers,
Benten, Ran and many others.

At certain places certain coordinates are given to you. You should go to them

enemies.  You get to choose from different characters to fight as depending
on where you are in the story.  During the fight, you have three "spirit
points" at your disposal.  You use these buy holding down the punch button
to charge you spirit meter.  When the spirit meter is fully charged, release
the punch button, and your spirit attack will be unleashed.

This is your standard street fighting game.  You can choose from the story
mode, team battle mode, or versus battle mode.

<P>

In the story mode, you control a team of five characters in the Underworld
tournament.  Before each battle, you can choose which character to use and how
much "power" and "spirit" he has in reserve.  There are two bonus games during
the tournament that allow you to increase the amount of "power" and "spirit"
available.

<P>

The team battle mode allows you to choose five characters from any of the
characters in the game.  Your team will then face a computer or second player
controlled team of five players to see who is the best team.

<P>

After playing the game a few times, you can pick up on the right character and
strategy to beat each opponent.  The order of the tournament opponents never
changes, so the only replay value comes from trying to figure out how to do
each character's special moves.

This game is part Zelda RPG, part side-scrolling fighting game.  You move
around the city talking to various characters.  After talking to the right
people or finding the right item, you enter an area where you walk around
fighting people until you reach the level boss.  You have a spirit meter,
but I haven't played the game enough to figure out how to pull of any
special moves.

While the fighting sequences and graphics aren't that impressive, I find
the concept of the game interesting.  Figuring out the special moves and
finding out where the stories are going will keep you busy for awhile.
