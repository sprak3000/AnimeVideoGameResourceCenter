<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">DOS Games</H2>
There aren't really many anime games out there for DOS (except for hentai
games which usually aren't based on a specific anime).  There have been
a few that I have come across; most of them seem to be unofficial games
(meaning that they were created without the consent of the owner of the
anime).

Dragonball is a PC 
knock-off of the fighting games for the Super Famicom.  You can control
either Son Goku or Kuririn.  The game control is very rough; the graphics
and music are adequate.  This is good for trading purposes, but the 
controls make it barely playable.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Dragonball RPG</H3>
<IMG SRC="../images/PC/db_rpg.jpg" ALT="[Dragonball RPG]" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=200>
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Towers/1987/goods.htm" TARGET="_top">Dragonball RPG</A> is a
Chinese-made game that is definitely an unofficial game.  The graphics are very poor, but the music is tolerable.  
Runs very fast on a 486.  Roger Nystrom has written a <A HREF="../dbz_rpg.txt" TARGET="_self">partial walkthrough and explination</A> 
of how the game works.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Veritech:  Variable Flight Simulator</H3>
<IMG SRC="../images/PC/mac_sim.gif" ALT="[Macross Flight Simulator]" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=200>
<A HREF="http://www.engr.ucdavis.edu/~smkhau/Veritech.zip">Veritech:  Variable Flight Simulator</A> is a 
fairly decent looking flight sim. that lets you control a Veritech from
<I>Macross</I>.  Since the name <I>Macross</I> is not used anywhere, it is
probably an unofficial game.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Macross:  Love Stories</H3>
<IMG SRC="../images/PC/mac_rpg.gif" ALT="[Macross:  Love Stories]" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=200>
<I>Macross:  Love Stories</I> is a typical mulitple-choice RPG.
This is probably an official game.  The drawings and music are very sharp.
  Unfortunately, this game is completely in Korean.  I don't really know
what the plot is or who you are (seems to be after the Macross crew gets
back to Earth.  Minmei seems very grown-up in the pictures).  Also, I 
can't seem to figure out how to exit the game.  If you know Korean or just
like Macross, get this game.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Sailor Moon World</H3>
<IMG SRC="../images/PC/sm_world.jpg" ALT="[Sailor Moon World]" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=200>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~phooee/smgame.html" TARGET="_top">Sailor Moon World</A> is 
a freeware game designed by Tim Yep.  It is a four player game in the 
style of <I>Final Fight</I>, <I>Double Dragon</I>, and countless other 
horizontal-scrolling fighters.  The code is currently undergoing a massive
 re-write.  While the demo is only 35% complete, it shows promise.
