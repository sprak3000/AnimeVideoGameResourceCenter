<IMG SRC="../images/console/nes.gif" ALT="[NES console]" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125>Just before the great US video game crash of 1984,  
Nintendo of Japan released a new 8-bit video game system called the Famicom.  In
1985, the Famicom was released to the US market as the Nintendo Entertainement
System.  The NES revitalized the video game industry in the US.  Eventually, the NES
gave way to its 16-bit successor the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.  Around
the same time, a top-loading, compact version of the NES was released as an 
alternative to the new and more expensive 16-bit SNES.  The NES still retains 
popularity with video game collectors due to several ground-breaking games such as
Final Fantasy, Ninja Gaiden, and Legend of Zelda.

<P>

The release of the NES also introduced a new concept to video gamers across the 
globe, territorial lockout.  Nintendo decided that it didn't want the US market to 
be able to play Japanese games.  Thus, the configuration of the Famicom and NES 
were created differently.  The hardware itself was not different, but the way 
cartridges interfaced with the NES deck was.  

<P>

Fortunately, people eventually found a way around this lockout.  An adaptor was 
created so you could plug in your 60 pin Famicom cartridge into the US 72 pin NES 
deck.  The most well-known and hard to find adaptor was from Honeybee.  Another 
recent adaptor was called the <I>Super 8</I>.  It allowed you to play NES, Famicom, 
and Super Famicom (Japanese SNES) games on your SNES.  I have never seen it sold 
anywhere and wrote the company for more information but never received a reply.  
Since NES carts go very cheap these days, someone also discovered a low cost 
solution.  Apparently, old cartidges made by Nintendo contain a convertor built-in.
