This is the DBZ pseudo role-playing game that came out on the heels of the
release of the Super GameBoy.  The storyline starts with the Piccolo
Tenkaichi-budokai and ends with the appearance of Vegeta.  You can also compete
just in the Tenkaichi-budokai or play the bonus games.

<P>

There is not much role-playing in the game.  The only choice that effects the
game is what position in the Tenkaichi-budokai you fight.  The battle commands
can be picked up quickly with some experimentation.

<P>

There are some bonus games where you can build up your stats.  Once you get the
feel for the combat menus, the game is fairly easy to beat.  Overall, the game
has some nice graphics, but the replay value is low because the story line
never really changes much.
