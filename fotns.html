This is the US translation of the game based on the anime called
<I>Hokuto no Ken</I>.  It is a street fighting game with very poor graphics.
The game play is also simple and uninteresting.  You have basic punches and
kicks.  You can charge up for one fireball blast, but that is the extent of
the game-play

This is a horizontal-scrolling fighting game.  You control Ken(?) as he punches
and kicks his way through hordes of enemies.  I am fairly sure this is a
glitch caused by NESA, but you can never die (I have just stood there for 
10 minutes letting the enemies shoot and hit me).  Overall, the game is
weak (especially the ending), but it is the only NES game I know of that
show people exploding.

To proceed to the next level, keep walking left until you find a doorway
with a little girl standing in it (she will appear and then disappear).
At this doorway, press A+B+Up.  Keep doing this until you find the level boss.

This is basically the same game as the first one except the graphics are a lot
sharper.  It is not a spectacular game, but it is one of the few Nintendo games
where you get to see people explode.
