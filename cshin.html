This is a Mario-style horizontal scrolling game.  You go from level to 
level collecting items.  Some items look like they can be used, but I 
haven't played it enough to find out what these items are used for.  It
has good graphics and good gameplay and will keep your interest for awhile.

This is a Mario-style horizontal scrolling game.  There are some other
carnival games that you can play as well.  The game has some humorous
power-ups; one power-up turns you into a chicken that can throw eggs at the
enemy.  While the game-play is not difficult, this game is cute and funny
enough to hold your attention for awhile.

<B>Turbo Mode:</B>  Enter the password: SHINCHANTURBO in hiragana.  (In other
words:  (shi)(n)(cha)(n)(ta)(a)(bo)).  There will be a space or two left over,
but the password will work.  I haven't completely tested it, but it seems to
start you off on level 5 with faster speed.  -- from Mike Koos
