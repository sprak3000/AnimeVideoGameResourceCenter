<H3>Description:</H3>
<PRE>
  It's a beautiful day at Tokyo Tower. Today, several schools have 
  come on tours.  Hikaru is looking through a pay-telescope when   
  her time runs out.  A girl from another school lends her money.  
  Hikaru runs after her to thank her and encounters a third girl   
  from yet another school.  Suddenly, a ball of light explodes     
  outside and Princess Emeraude appears begging for help.  The 3   
  girls fall into a world with floating islands and great forests. 
  The wizard Dosh Clef greets them and tells them that they are in 
  a realm known as Cefiro.  They have been called by Princess      
  Emeraude to save her and her world for they are the legendary    
  Magic Knights.  At a glance, Clef can tell that the girls are    
  hardly ready to assume those roles, but they WERE chosen, so he  
  transforms them.  He gives brief instructions on their powers    
  (though only Hikaru is listening) before they're attacked.  Clef 
  is turned to stone, but the 3 girls get away.  Their quest is to 
  find the Legendary Machines and use their power to save Cefiro   
  and the Princess from the evil and powerful Zagato.  These are   
  the Legendary Magic Knights:                                     
     Hikaru - the shortest and the oldest, she is the most         
       enthusiastic, even though she doesn't know what an RPG is.  
     Umi - a little snobbish, she is also the most homesick:       
       &quot;Can YOU take us back to Tokyo Tower?&quot;.                     
     Fuu - quiet and analytical, she may end up having the most    
       personal connection to the world of Cefiro...               

  NOTE: Though the series inserts comical Super-Deformed scenes,   
    the general mood remains serious.  Through their adventures,   
    the girls will learn how to use their powers to get ready for  
    the final confrontation.                                       

  NOTE: A little naming oddity.  Besides the Magic Knights, almost 
    all the characters (and Cefiro itself!) are named after cars   
    sold domestically in Japan.
