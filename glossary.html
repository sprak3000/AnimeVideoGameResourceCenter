<DT> <B>Action RPG:</B>
	<DD>Genre made famous by <I>The Legend of Zelda</I>.  Contains the typical RPG elements of
	exploring dungeons, solving puzzles, etc.  Combat takes place in real-time rather than turn-based
	format.  Enemies roam around on the screen; you must avoid running into their attacks while
	attacking them.

	In 1982, a Z80-based family of machines known as the MSX was introduced.  While gaining popularity in Asia, South America, the former 
	Soviet Union,  and Europe, the MSX remained virtually unknown in the US until the emulation scene revived interest in it.  The whole MSX project 
	was designed to establish a single home computing standard similar to the VHS standard for video equipment.  The MSX standard was developed 
	by a company called <I>ASCII</I> in cooperation with <I>Microsoft</I> (rumor has it MSX stands for <I>MicroSoft eXtended</I>).  
	A hard-wired version of Microsoft's BASIC was built into the MSX machine.  Before its demise in 1988, the <I>MSX2</I>, <I>MSX2+</I>, and 
	<I>TurboR</I> versions were created.

	I first heard of this device roughly around 1995.  It was slated for release as a new accessory for the Super Famicom in Japan.
	It would use smaller cartridges and allow developers to design smaller games with many parts.  Since then, I heard nothing
	more about this device until now.  Lasse Reinikainen has informed me that the <I>Sufami Turbo</I> did not become vaporware.
	What follows below is what he has learned about this device.

	<P>The <I>Sufami Turbo</I> is add-on unit for Super Famicom.  You plug it into the game module connector as a normal 
	game module.  <I>Sufami Turbo</I> has two game module slots (not normal ones).

	<P>The idea must be something like this:  <I>Sufami Turbo</I> has some built-in resources (Japanese fonts, etc.) that 
	allows you to save space when releasing modules (cartridges) for it.  Possibly there is some multiplayer capabilities 
	as well.  I think the biggest advantage was that you can forget Nintendo and release games without licensing them 
	(no paying money to Nintendo).

	<P>Jacob Poon adds that it's biggest feature is the ability to have two cartridges to share common resources.  It is much 
	like Sega's <I>Sonic and Knuckles</I> device.  For example, you can plug in two SD Ultraman games and use Ultraseven
	in the game he is not featured in.

<P><DT> <B>Territorial Lock Out:</B>
	<DD>Any mechanism designed to prevent you from playing games desinged in one country (e.g., Japan) on a console sold
	in another country (e.g., US).  For example, you cannot play a Japanese PSX game on a PSX console sold in the US without
	modifiying the console.
