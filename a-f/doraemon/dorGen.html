You run around the levels collecting stars and super stars.  After collecting so many super stars, 
you are taken to a bonus round where you must catch as many stars as you can before time runs 
out.  Many enemies stand in your way, but you are armed with your trusty freeze ray.  Once an 
enemy is frozen, you can jump on him and use him as a platform to jump to higher areas.  The 
frozen enemy can also be picked up and thrown at other enemies to destroy them.  If you hold 
down long enough, Doraemon starts flashing indicating he is  powered up for a super jump.  The 
background for the levels are made to look like pages out of the manga.
