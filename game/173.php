any masked person in the game or any of the bonus items that fly across the screen. You have three lives and lose a life if you are
shot or shoot Lupin, Jigen, or Goemon. Be careful! The villians will disguise themselves as Lupin and his gang but are still easily
spotted by the mask they wear. Bonus items are worth various amounts of points and consist of Jigen's hat or a hamburger.		</td>
