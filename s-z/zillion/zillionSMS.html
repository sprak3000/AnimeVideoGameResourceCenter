<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">From Doug Cranston:</H3>
Zillion was started by Sega in the early 1980's as a toy called a <I>Zillion Gun</I>; it was a laser-tag gun with a sensor 
pack that looks exactly like the ones in the anime.  To promote this toy, Sega commissioned a manga, which did well, 
and to capitalize on the popularity, Tatsunoko made an OVA series.  This game is a lot like <I>Metroid</I>.  You have to 
enter rooms, find pieces of a code, avoid security, and input the code in the computer in order to advance to other rooms.  
The objective of the game is to find Zillium for your guns, rescue your partners Apple and Champ (who you can control), 
and find five self-destruct disks to destroy the base.  It had pretty good renditions of the anime's music, rather than 
generic stuff.

You must guide your hero through the various levels battling the enemy along the way.  Not a
spectacular game, but fun to play anyway.
