<p>You run around the levels collecting stars and super stars. After collecting so many super stars, you are taken to a bonus round where you must catch as many stars as you can before time runs out. Many enemies stand in your way, but you are armed with your trusty freeze ray. Once an enemy is frozen, you can jump on him and use him as a platform to jump to higher areas. The frozen enemy can also be picked up and thrown at other enemies to destroy them. If you hold down long enough, Doraemon starts flashing indicating he is powered up for a super jump. The background for the levels are made to look like pages out of the manga.</p>		</td>
